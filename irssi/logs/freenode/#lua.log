20:27  PfhatWork> If I'm calling a C function from Lua
20:27  PfhatWork> how can I get that C function's environment table?
20:27  PfhatWork> (while inside of it)
20:30  PfhatWork> Wait.. can you even (normally) set an environment for a C function?
20:30  cbreak> with LUA_ENVIRONINDEX?
20:30  PfhatWork> oh!
20:30  PfhatWork> wonderful :D
20:30  cbreak> hmm...
20:30  PfhatWork> I wasn't aware of that
20:30  cbreak> not sure
20:30  cbreak> I never did that
20:31  cbreak> it's under 3.3 in the lua manual
20:31  PfhatWork> I never even though to check that out :X
20:31  PfhatWork> thought.
20:32  PfhatWork> I used to have a separate lua context for each of these objects I'm working with
20:32  PfhatWork> I just merged them all together, but I didn't want to change the way you had to write certain things (like when calling a function registered with the object, it used to just go to the global table, now it goes to the object's table)
20:32  PfhatWork> so I set the functions' environment to be the new object table
20:32  PfhatWork> but let me see if this works, it should...
20:33  PfhatWork> Success! :)
20:33  PfhatWork> Thank you.
20:33  cbreak> sounds weird.
20:33  cbreak> usually you'd use the object syntax for calls
20:33  cbreak> myObject:myMethod()
20:33  q:Sculptor:(n=sculptor@77.46.220.16)
20:34  cbreak> maybe. :)
20:34  PfhatWork> well, typically I would do that yes
20:34  j:sculptor:(n=sculptor@77.46.220.16)
20:34  PfhatWork> but the idea here is that, as far as the object is concerned, it's in its own state
20:35  PfhatWork> so it's basically just pretending that its global table is the object table
20:35  PfhatWork> and everything just works :P
20:36  PfhatWork> (there is a specific purpose for these objects, they're not generic in the sense that other objects will interact with them)
20:36  PfhatWork> at least, not through lua directly

21:28  Slade-> sup keffo
21:28  Slade-> long time ;)
21:28  Keffo> yoyo
21:29  Shirik> you have something against registering, Slade-?
21:29  Keffo> with no trolls, it serves little purpose
21:29  Keffo> priv. msg sure, but not here
21:30  Slade-> correct.
21:30  Slade-> i feel no need to maintain another password, or password scheme or give someone else my email address for what amounts to no purpose
21:31  sztanpet> you cant know when a kiddie comes along who got offended by an answer and brings a hundred bots with him
21:31  sztanpet> happened so many times

21:32  Shirik> except he's not in this channel
21:32  j:demi_alucard:(n=tensai@189.61.92.52)
21:32  Slade-> yea. fortunately every irc client since 1988 has had an ignore function
21:32  Keffo> sztanpet, this is #lua, to my knowledge any major issue like that has happened once the last 2-3 years
21:32  Shirik> Slade-: Ignore doesn't do much good against a botnet
21:32  Slade-> you'd be surprised
21:32  Shirik> what, are you going to ignore *!*@*?
21:32  Slade-> no. first few lines get them added to ignore automatically
21:33  Shirik> what if they say only one thing and leave?
21:33  Slade-> then i dont really care
21:33  sztanpet> and registering saves you a lot of pain either way
21:33  Shirik> uh
21:33  Shirik> You don't?
21:33  Slade-> my brain filters quite well as well
21:33  Shirik> I hope you never meet this spammer then :)
21:33  Shirik> It filters 100 messages a minute?
21:34  Shirik> On this note, I haven't seen this problem in #lua in a very long itme
21:34  Shirik> time*
21:34  sztanpet> that doesnt mean it wont happen ever again
21:34  Shirik> however it was so bad in other channels I ended up writing a bot in Lua just to handle it :)
21:34  Slade-> i'm used to the fights on efnet.. anything that can happen here to me is tame in comparison
21:35  Shirik> I think you underestimate this style of spam, Slade-, but I am not going to pursue you to agree with me
21:35  Slade-> if it gets bad i can type a command and everyone in the channel who talks who isnt on my list ends up in a different window
21:35  Keffo> normal -> problem -> turn on reg -> problem solved -> time passes -> remove reg -> now(tm)
21:35  Shirik> Keffo: Exactly what my bot does :)
21:36  Shirik> to take care of the 3 AM attacks when nobody is awake
21:36  Slade-> right, a detail for chanadmins, not me
21:36  Keffo> but with loops and sqrt()'s I hope?
21:36  Shirik> sqrt?
21:36  Slade-> cause i care if someones spamming me in irc at 3am
21:36  Keffo> http://giger.servebeer.com/temp/pow.jpg
21:36  Slade-> err. when i'm not away
21:36  Keffo> nerd humour
21:36  Slade-> awake
21:36  Shirik> haha
21:36  Keffo> made one with sqrt(); too, but it's not really work safe.. :)
21:38  Slade-> bah i'm in 4 channels again. too many :(
21:38  Keffo> I'm always only here :)
21:38  *** Shirik stares at his 13 channels >.>

21:38  *** blankthemuffin stares at 15 channels over 2 servers, usually it's 18 over three servers.

21:43  Slade-> so whats the new exciting luay things going on
21:44  Keffo> lots of people parsing text, I think
21:45  Slade-> lua does it pretty well
21:45  Keffo> sure, but far from exciting!
21:45  Keffo> no coder-boners from that
21:45  Slade-> hows your rendering coming
21:45  Keffo> very not at all at the moment
21:45  Keffo> too much other fluff going on
21:46  Slade-> fluff like what
21:46  Keffo> but I'm gonna rewrite it soon I think

21:46  Slade-> oh yea?
21:46  Slade-> everyones looking at that.. i've ignored it :P
21:46  Slade-> maybe i shouldnt
21:46  Keffo> which is conceptually very similar, just not the same rendering, but the distribution etc.
21:46  Keffo> and now has lots of lua in it :)
21:46  Slade-> heh

21:48  Keffo> not a peep in here or the mailinglist
21:48  Keffo> just vanished
21:49  Slade-> emailed him a while ago.. no response
21:49  Keffo> really?
21:49  Slade-> yea.
21:49  Keffo> maybe something has happened to him?
21:49  Slade-> hope hes just on vacation 
21:49  Keffo> It's been well over 6 months I think
21:50  Slade-> maybe he gave up lua for python :P
21:50  Keffo> he was going to szhc(!)witzerland to work for google or something
21:51  Slade-> heh went to see if hes in the python channel, but cant even go in there unless you're registered
21:51  Keffo> but why would he vanish from the l-list then?

01:22  pquerna> hi, i'm trying to us elua_dump to dump a function, and then later run it via loadBuffer... I did this a few years ago.. But I can'tseem to get it to work tonight.
01:22  pquerna> http://lua.pastey.net/101015
01:22  pquerna> the buffer that I get back is 12 bytes, way too small for the function -- if i use the interactive lua, and use string.dump(), i get 236 bytes, which is what I would expect.
01:23  pquerna> i'm wondering if i'm missing something stupid before the dump (?)
01:29  pquerna> !seen rici
01:31  pquerna> i wish rici still used irc. the big google gobbled him up.
01:37  q:demi_alucard:(n=tensai@189.61.92.52)
01:39  snogglethorpe> pquerna: well pretty soon _everybody_ will be working for google, then everybody can just chat at staff meetings

01:42  q:rabbit-:(n=johannes@220-253-45-140.VIC.netspace.net.au)
01:58  ToxicFrog> pquerna: I would guess the problem is in ldump_writer
02:00  j:batcoder-7:(n=comp@unaffiliated/batcoder-7)
02:01  pquerna> ToxicFrog: actually, tracing it, i think i'm not loading into the state right, which is weird. I can force a syntax error, but if I do a getgloabl("foo"); after loading, it says its not there....
02:01  batcoder-7> anyway to do a system wide install of lua  on windows ? 
02:02  pquerna> (fwiw, this is in mod_wombat -> https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_wombat/trunk/mod_wombat.c )
02:03  ToxicFrog> pquerna: I note that if the file you're loading makes assignments, those won't be reflected until you call the function, which youj don't seem to be doing
02:04  ToxicFrog> (the function generated by passing lua_load the file, that is)
02:05  batcoder-7> also anyone here use the kepler project ? 
02:05  batcoder-7> or lua CGI any of that ? 
02:06  pquerna> hmm
02:08  ToxicFrog> System wide install of lua: you can put lua.exe/luac.exe/lua.dll in PATH, for the runtime; for headers and libraries windows doesn't really have a "system" location, put them wherever your build system expects them to be.
02:08  ToxicFrog> Kepler/CGI: I do not, but others here do.
02:08  pquerna> ToxicFrog: http://lua.pastey.net/101024 , now i'm trying to remember lua foo, but isn't there somethng about function foo body end actually being foo = function body end....
02:09  pquerna> so... hmm.
02:12  ToxicFrog> Yes. Function declaration is sugar for variable assignment.
02:12  ToxicFrog> Loading a file simply generates a function from it; that is all.
02:12  pquerna> right, but I can't really just add a lua_pcall() at the end.
02:12  pquerna> right
02:12  ToxicFrog> If that file contains you want executed - including assignments - you need to call or pcall the loaded function.
02:13  ToxicFrog> I think this is seperate from the lua_dump issue, though
02:13  pquerna> well, I don't want it to execute, I just want it to byte code so I can run it later
02:13  pquerna> i have execution working fine from a file
02:14  pquerna> just trying to get inline lua chunks in the httpd.conf working right :-)
02:14  ToxicFrog> Right.
02:14  ToxicFrog> Just saying, if all you've done is load it, foo not being defined is totally normal.
02:14  ToxicFrog> Although - why dump it rather than, say, store it in the registry? Planning to move it between states?
02:15  q:THC4k:(n=Miranda@p5B0C903B.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
02:15  pquerna> move betwen states
02:15  pquerna> byte code once, but lots of states possible in the long run
02:15  ToxicFrog> Right.
02:15  ToxicFrog> So you want to save it as bytecode so that future loads are a memcpy rather than a compile.
02:16  pquerna> yep
02:16  ToxicFrog> Well, the code you pasted looks fine to me, so either it's a problem in the chunk writer or it's something I'm missing.
02:16  ToxicFrog> The latter is entirely possible as it is 2am, but I lean towards the former.
02:17  pquerna> hmm. well, the chunk writer is pretty simple, just appending to the lua buffer
02:18  pquerna> and it is only getting called once
02:18  pquerna> for a write of 12 bytes
02:18  pquerna> which is why i was going back to the load stuff.
02:20  ToxicFrog> Huh.
02:20  ToxicFrog> But the load succeeds?
02:20  pquerna> yup
02:21  ToxicFrog> Have you tried writing out the dumped function to disk and calling luac -l on it?
02:21  j:sculptor:(n=sculptor@77.46.220.16)
02:21  ToxicFrog> 12 bytes seems really short, though.
02:22  ToxicFrog> Hmm.
02:23  pquerna> yeah, the function name is longer than that :P
02:23  ToxicFrog> Ok, even a single-instruction function (RETURN 0 1) weighs 67.
02:23  pquerna> its like an empty state
02:23  pquerna> or something is at 0 in the stack
02:23  ToxicFrog> 0 isn't a valid stack index.
02:23  pquerna> which makes me think i'm doing something stupid :P
02:25  j:ttmrichter:(n=ttmricht@58.49.19.241)

17:02  PovAddict> is top X based on downloads or rating?
17:02  TheBunny> N is top is by units sold I believe
17:03  TheBunny> ratings have no real effect in that regards today.

09:08  zmyrgel> Could somebody help me in debuggin why my apps won't get directed to right tags
09:08  zmyrgel> http://rafb.net/p/PwYyzL71.html
09:09  mkrist> zmyrgel, I would like to recommend qiv instead of feh for you.. don't take this the wrong way, I just thought qiv was much better when I first discovered it, just FYI :)
09:10  zmyrgel> mkrist: I'll look into it though feh has worked for me just fine
09:10  mkrist> cool

09:29  zmyrgel> no ideas why my hook_manage isn't working?
09:29  j:oahong:(~user@61.172.193.245)
09:30  asmanian> zmyrgel: what exactly is your problem?
09:31  zmyrgel> asmanian: for example when I open thunderbird it opens in active tag and won't get moved to 'mail' tag as it should
09:31  asmanian> can you paste your rc.lua?
09:31  zmyrgel>  http://rafb.net/p/PwYyzL71.html
09:34  asmanian> hm doesn't look wrong on a first sight
09:34  asmanian> did you try some print-debugging?
09:34  zmyrgel> no
09:34  asmanian> maybe that helps
09:34  asmanian> for example print(target.tag) before the "if target" stuff
09:35  asmanian> output should land in .xsession-errors (depending on your X setup)
09:35  j:linduxed:(~linduxed@p211.kthopen.kth.se)
09:37  zmyrgel> it gives "W: awesome: luaA_dofunction:238: error running function: /home/zmyrgel/.config/awesome/rc.lua:587: attempt to index global 'target' (a nil value)"
09:38  asmanian> ah
09:38  asmanian> ic
09:39  asmanian> you used "local target = ..." inside the ifs
09:39  asmanian> maybe that declares it local to the if block?
09:39  zmyrgel> could be
09:39  asmanian> not sure how local exactly works though
09:40  asmanian> maybe just leave the local away
09:41  asmanian> http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.6
09:41  asmanian> seems so
09:42  asmanian> you could also do something along the lines
09:42  asmanian> local target
09:42  asmanian> if foo bar ... then target = something end
09:44  q:farhaven:(~gregor@Qc13e.q.pppool.de)
09:45  zmyrgel> I added the 'local target' outside the apptags ifs but still nothing
09:46  asmanian> still the same error message?
09:46  asmanian> you did remove the "local" inside the if-blocks?
09:47  zmyrgel> yeah, now it complains about the target inside the 'if target then' block :/
09:48  zmyrgel> sorry
09:48  zmyrgel> I added print statement above the if target, print (target.tag) and it complains about that
09:49  q:linduxed:(~linduxed@p211.kthopen.kth.se)
09:49  asmanian> ah naturally
09:50  asmanian> because if target is nil, target.tag will give an error
09:50  asmanian> so better but the print statement inside the "if target"
09:50  zmyrgel> yeah, just figured that out
09:51  q:mkrist:(~mkrist@77.75.167.214)

10:11  zmyrgel> I now opened thunderbird and it almost seem to notice it, http://rafb.net/p/Swj1rQ67.html
10:11  zmyrgel> it lists the mail and 1 but still won't move it
10:22  j:Marenz:(~anonym001@vpn-stud.rz-zw.fh-kl.de)
10:24  zmyrgel> when opening a client it first gives 'no running windows found' then it complains about indexing the target... about a half a second later it lists the correct values

10:36  pyrho> (sry)
10:36  j:lukhas:(~lucas@rincevent.net)
10:36  lukhas> hello
10:36  pyrho> hey
10:37  lukhas> after a few weeks using awesome, I'm finally starting to get the hang of it :)
10:37  oxmoz> :)
10:37  lukhas> and I have to say it kinda rocks
10:37  pyrho> "kinda" ?
10:37  zmyrgel> pyrho: nope, but it wouldn't help as other apps are affected too
10:37  pyrho> zmyrgel: did you try with de default config ?
10:38  pyrho> s/de/the/
10:38  pyrho> ;x
10:38  lukhas> there are still some things that I don't get, and there is no much doc around to help, apart from the API doc :)
10:38  zmyrgel> pyrho: yeah, the default config works
10:38  lukhas> especially all the clients resizing and layout manipulations
10:38  pyrho> zmyrgel: then add you modifications to the default one ^^
10:38  lukhas> thankfully the default config file is helping a lot
10:39  pyrho> lukhas: perhaps we can help, what's unclear about layouts/resizing ?
10:40  lukhas> say I've got a layout with 2 masters above, and 1 slave under
10:40  lukhas> hmm, wait, I'll make a screenshot, it'll help :)
10:41  pyrho> you're drawing your screenshot ? :P
10:42  lukhas> http://rincevent.net/~lucas/layout1.png
10:42  lukhas> no, I'm using terminals instead of confindential data :)
10:42  pyrho> :P fine
10:42  pyrho> so what's the matter ?
10:42  lukhas> is there a way I can enlarge master 1 ?
10:42  lukhas> take more space to the right
10:42  pyrho> not to my knowledge
10:42  lukhas> reducing master2 width
10:43  oxmoz> you can't at the moment
10:43  lukhas> ah, that explains why I couldn't find the keybinding :)
10:43  q:bash:(~bash@89-97-140-221.ip17.fastwebnet.it)
10:43  jd_> nop, lukhas 
10:43  jd_> you can only resize in one way
10:43  pyrho> since awesome is an automatic tiling window manager it defines space taken by the windows automatically
10:43  pyrho> you can resize master/slave-wise only
10:43  lukhas> too bad
10:43  lukhas> I'll have to buy a bigger screen then
10:43  asmanian> I wonder if it wouldn't be possible to have a design where you are able to resize each single window
10:44  pyrho> btw jd_ id there was a "free-tiled" layout (as in ion) it would be cool :D
10:44  jd_> lukhas: well it has been heavily discussed and no one found a good solution so far to implement this
10:44  lukhas> ok
10:44  asmanian> and the rest resizes accordingly naturally
10:44  lukhas> how about a fully manual system?
10:44  jd_> pyrho: not yet, later when everything will be exported to Lua
10:44  lukhas> a new layout
10:44  asmanian> ion is fully manually
10:44  pyrho> "everything exported to lua" ?
10:44  jd_> lukhas: why is there sheep in your bar?
10:44  jd_> pyrho: when layouts will be written in Lua and no more in C
10:45  lukhas> jd_: http://www.workrave.org/welcome/ :)
10:45  pyrho> jd_: okay :)
10:45  asmanian> I used it for some time but found it enerving to always have to specify splittings and frames
10:45  lukhas> "The program frequently alerts you to take micro-pauses, rest breaks and restricts you to your daily limit."
10:45  pyrho> asmanian: i liked it (:
10:45  pyrho> lukhas: that's a procrastination device !
10:45  asmanian> the number of windows changed too often for mee
10:46  lukhas> pyrho: no, that merely helps avoiding RSI
10:46  lukhas> I can procrastinate by myself
10:46  pyrho> asmanian: but the tiles where saved
10:46  asmanian> so I always had either to reconfigure the desktop or have too much windows hidden or wasted space
10:46  asmanian> yeah but there werent any 2 sessions where I needed the same layout ^^
10:46  pyrho> one desktop per purpose, but still awesome >> ion (:
10:47  asmanian> it simply wasn't dynamic enough for what I needed
10:47  asmanian> ^^
10:47  lukhas> jd_: in Xfce systray there was only one sheep icon, though :)
10:47  lukhas> dunno why they are 2 of them now
10:47  asmanian> but maybe an *additional* ion-like layout for awesome would be cool
10:47  pyrho> asmanian: agreed
10:48  pyrho> or at least the possibility to resize each window seperatly
10:48  pyrho> (with no empty tiles in mean)
10:48  asmanian> ack
10:48  lukhas> I'd love a fully-manual layout too
10:48  lukhas> even though the automatic mode is nice most of the times
10:49  lukhas> oh, another question, while I'm at it: where should I hack to prevent new clients from becoming masters ?
10:49  lukhas> ok for getting focus, but not for stealing master status and using all my screen :)
10:50  pyrho> dunno that :/
10:52  pyrho> screenshot time ! show me/us(if anyone cares) your desktops
10:52  j:bash:(~bash@89-97-140-221.ip17.fastwebnet.it)
10:52  pyrho> http://omploader.org/vdzR5
10:52  lukhas> already shown mine :)
10:52  pyrho> yep (:
10:53  asmanian> my cool one is on my notebook
10:53  asmanian> here is only pretty much default setup
10:53  asmanian> so nothing really showable
10:53  q:Marenz:(~anonym001@vpn-stud.rz-zw.fh-kl.de)
10:54  pjock> http://www.cs.umu.se/~c05jgn/school.png here's the one i use at uni.. that's like awesome 2.0 or something :)
10:54  asmanian> nice background image
10:54  pjock> (i run git at home)
10:54  pyrho> asmanian: ty (:
10:54  pjock> heh yeah mine at uni is default too i guess..
10:54  pyrho> pjock: doing some heavy work at uni as we can see :P
10:54  lukhas> yup, I really need a bigger screen :)
10:54  pjock> lol :)
10:55  asmanian> pyrho: on your first scrot whats the bottom status line?
10:55  pjock> can't beat this psycho slime.. :P
10:55  asmanian> is that a conky?
10:55  jd_> yeah, I'll test workrave
10:55  pyrho> asmanian: nope wicked widgets
10:55  asmanian> ic
10:55  asmanian> n1
10:55  pyrho> ty (:
10:56  lukhas> jd_: it can be pretty annoying sometimes, but I clearly noticed that I no longer have pain in my hands after a full workday typing on the keyboard
10:57  pyrho> lukhas: <troll> you switch from emacs to vi ? (notice the unclosed <troll>).
10:57  lukhas> oh, and I have a typematrix keyboard + dvorak-fr layout, that helps too :)
10:57  jd_> too bad I never have pain
10:57  lukhas> pyrho: I use vim on our servers
10:57  lukhas> jd_: lucky :)
10:57  jd_> I just want to make coffee pauses
10:57  jd_> AH! it's time to do some micro pause
10:57  *** jd_ goes get coffee
10:58  lukhas> well, a coffee pause every 10 minutes will probably kill you by caffeine overdose
10:58  jd_> lol
10:58  jd_> actually I just wanted to see the ship, seems to work fine here, I've only one icon and one "progress bar" icon
10:58  jd_> sheep 
10:59  jd_> not the ship
10:59  lukhas> oh, I disabled the progress bar
10:59  lukhas> so that explains the second sheep then, it's the "disabled" progress bar
11:00  jd_> probably
11:00  lukhas> I can live with that, both icons behave the same anyway
11:00  lukhas> (righ-click wise)
11:01  asmanian> another survey
11:01  asmanian> which operating system / distribution do you use?
11:01  pyrho> Linux / arch
11:01  lukhas> Debian sid
11:01  asmanian> I use arch on my  laptop and debian on my desktop, but find it annoying that debian is still at 2.x so I'm searching for something new to try
11:02  pyrho> (+Windows / XP and *BSD / MacOS)
11:02  asmanian> whoot you use everything ;)
11:02  pyrho> ^^, mainly linux
11:02  lukhas> asmanian: use the experimental package
11:02  lukhas> works well here
11:02  pyrho> windows's for gaming only ^^, and mac on my laptop
11:03  jd_> Debian sid
11:03  asmanian> does it need a sepecial sources list entry?
11:03  lukhas> asmanian: yes
11:03  asmanian> ah sid ic
11:03  lukhas> asmanian: # Experimental
11:03  lukhas> deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib 
11:03  asmanian> thnx
11:04  lukhas> and then aptitude install -t experimental awesome should work
11:04  lukhas> you will probably have to remove some awesome2 packages
11:04  lukhas> oh, and rewrite your config :)
11:05  asmanian> well I am currently using a self compiled release candidate of 3
11:05  asmanian> and I have a working 3.0 config on my laptop so no problem
11:05  lukhas> no rewrite then :)
11:05  asmanian> yeah there where some slight changes during the release candidates but nothing gruesome iirc
11:07  asmanian> pyrho: I'm sometimes on the edge to try a bsd
11:07  asmanian> would you recommend it as a substitute for a linux desktop system?
11:07  pyrho> asmanian: I haven't got musch experience in BSD systems, all I know is that BSD is sh*t :)
11:08  pyrho> their licence is too restrictive
11:08  asmanian> k that matches with my impressions ;)
11:08  pjock> gpl is way more restrictive than bsd license :o
11:08  lukhas> and BSD is to free for their own good :)
11:09  lukhas> We Know Better
11:09  pyrho> but bsd licenced codes are outdated
11:09  jd_> that's wrong
11:09  pyrho> have you ever worked on FreeBSD ?
11:10  jd_> you can't say such statements, BSD just have a smaller community so it's just more slow
11:10  pyrho> man pages are 2 lines long, where you can read "that is broken, and we won't fix it"
11:10  jd_> but well 10 years ago Linux was this slow, equally
11:10  pyrho> like I said before: "I haven't got musch experience in BSD systems"
11:11  zmyrgel> I consider openbsd much better than linux :)
11:11  pyrho> (: so i'm just talking with my small experience
11:11  jd_> hum, I think we did not read the same BSD documentations manpages are much better and up to date than Linux ones
11:11  jd_> ok pyrho :)
11:11  asmanian> zmyrgel: better in which way?
11:11  jd_> I used OpenBSD for years (not as desktop, but as router) and despite I just hate the OpenBSD guys for being asshole, the system is quite nice on the integration and documentation side
11:11  zmyrgel> asmanian: just plain better, it feels like how OS should be done ... atleast to me :)
11:12  jd_> even better than many linux distro
11:12  pyrho> jd_: then it might just be a FreeBSD problem (:
11:12  zmyrgel> jd_: Why OpenBDS guys are assholes?
11:12  jd_> pyrho: did not use much FreeBSD, it was not able to run on my system, but AFAIK it's OpenBSD with more people, more software and more fresh drivers, kernel and innovation, so that might be even better
11:13  pyrho> i'll give it a try then, one day :)
11:13  zmyrgel> finally got dri to my openbsd laptop :)
11:14  jd_> zmyrgel: that's the point of view I made after a few years of using, and following it - YMMV :)
11:14  xorg62> hello
11:14  pyrho> hey xorg62 
11:15  jd_> zmyrgel: they are a bit stubborn and not always drive things in the good way IMHO, I do prefer NetBSD (it's so cute) or FreeBSD
11:15  jd_> but just things like packet filter is worth using OpenBSD
11:15  zmyrgel> jd_: yeah, I remember the first time I stumbled to OpenBSD world... rough times, the community was quite different than linux community :)
11:15  pyrho> zmyrgel: like how ?
11:16  zmyrgel> pyrho: in linux community you can ask anything, in openbsd community you can ask anything that's not documented in man pages :)
11:16  pyrho> hehe k :)
11:16  jd_> Linux community is so wide nowadays, I think that does not make much sense to talk about it, it's like talking about humans being: you'll find nice guys, you'll find asshols, etc...
11:17  jd_> it's no more elitist like BSD can be
11:17  jd_> (which is not a criticism, just a fact)
11:17  pyrho> k
11:17  jd_> i.e. they're not so many newbies using NetBSD...
11:17  pyrho> you're saying we are noobs ? :P
11:18  jd_> don't know, are you? :P
11:19  pyrho> depends on who you're comparing to (:

13:13  Cygal> jd_, awesome :D
13:14  jd_> farhaven: google awesomeness poster ;)
13:16  damjan> BTW, I've setup my awesome so that in a dual-head configuration the external screen doesn't have tags, nor a wibox, not anything ... I only use that screen for windows I explicitily put there
13:16  farhaven> but why?
13:16  damjan> .. so if anyone is intereseted I can share them
13:17  farhaven> there's a wiki page for user configs
13:17  damjan> farhaven: because I only use the second head on public presentations 
13:17  farhaven> hmm, makes sense
13:17  damjan> brb
13:23  stillunknown> That's actually a very common usecase on notebook.

21:48  gregf> yeah first time playing with wmii kinda scared me, going with awesome is a lot less scary though imo. Seems a lot easier to move around if your used to a box wm.
21:48  gregf> http://stuff.gregf.org/screenshots/11.2008/desktop-11.07.08.png < my new theme... normally got irssi tiling but wanted to show everything off.

21:52  tychoish> how do you do screenshots (for the friend) whose having problems with awesome-menu
21:52  gregf> i use a ruby script that takes it and scp's it to my server for me. Umm but for a general program I use scrot to take them. http://www.linuxbrit.co.uk/
21:53  tychoish> that's kinda nifty ;)
21:53  gregf> if you want the ruby script i think its in my github

22:38  jt_> yeah
22:39  jt_> why do people do that? it doesn't change anything...at least in irssi it does. this isn't vim ( :( )
22:40  tychoish> because it's more compact than say "I say chap did you intended to type tags rather than, tabs, or am I mistaken"
22:40  rbistolfi> its a quick way for pointing a mistake, nothing more

00:29  gregf> like I said might be different on your box as what I gave you is not my whole file, normally directories are blue, and mp3s would be red
00:29  binarymutant> when I add a file to /usr/bin how do I get it to be displayed in dmenu?
00:30  gregf> Jakob_the_liar: sorry green for mp3's
00:30  gregf> binarymutant: unless i'm mistaking once its there and you bring up a new dmenu isntance it should just work
00:30  Jakob_the_liar> na mp3 is pink 
00:30  Jakob_the_liar> and directories are blue

00:34  gregf> droid sans mono, andale, manaco, proggy, terminus
00:34  gregf> bitstream vera is also popular
00:34  Vinnonet> Hey guys, is it possible somehow instead of getting the system beep for rxvt, make it like flash or something so awesome can get it as urgent.
00:35  Jakob_the_liar> if you find out Vinnonet let me know
00:35  gregf> Vinnonet: well flashing on a error and getting urgent are two different things
00:35  gregf> both are possible
00:35  gregf> you want to do both or just one
00:36  gregf> also depends on your terminal
00:36  Vinnonet> What would i google for for more info on it?
00:36  gregf> happy to help if you let me know what one you want and your terminal
00:37  gregf> not sure though, maybe xterm +urgent
00:37  Vinnonet> because using pidgin, it would send a urgent flash thing on my tag in awesome, now that im using centerim/irssi, it just beeps
00:37  Vinnonet> im using rxvt-unicode
00:37  gregf> 1 sec i'll check the manpage i got it set for xterm so should be easy to find
00:37  Vinnonet> Oh O.o, thanks.
00:38  gregf> k
00:38  gregf> you know how to set stuff in .Xdefaults? that safe to assume?
00:39  Vinnonet> Yeah.
00:39  gregf> well if so, you'll want to add this URxvt*urgentOnBell: true and URxvt*visualBell: true
00:39  gregf> then run xrdb -load .Xdefaults
00:39  gregf> and open a new urxvt
00:39  gregf> well guess you dont have to if you run xrdb in each client you have open
00:39  gregf> that should do it
00:40  Jakob_the_liar> Nautilus can't be used now, due to an unexpected error from Bonobo when attempting to locate the factory. Killing bonobo-activation-server and restarting Nautilus may help fix the problem.
00:40  gregf> if you want to have irssi alert you on urgent too you can run this... /set beep_msg_level = "MSGS NOTICES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT"
00:40  gregf> then /save
00:40  Jakob_the_liar> gregf, ?
00:40  Jakob_the_liar> that just happend
00:40  Jakob_the_liar> i was able to use nautilus just a second ago
00:41  gregf> not saying it isn't but I can't see how anything in your xdefaults could be effect nautilus
00:41  gregf> if   you want to be sure comment what i gave you with ! run xrdb again and see if it fixes it
00:41  gregf> i really don't think that would be it though
00:42  gregf> Vinnonet: hope that works for you, i'm about to crash though 
00:42  j:kanru:(~kanru@220-132-104-233.HINET-IP.hinet.net)
00:43  Vinnonet> testing it now.
00:43  Vinnonet> Thanks for that though.
00:44  gregf> Vinnonet: np, think that should work just fine. I use xterm but its pretty much the same setting names. there in the man page if you need to check them over.
00:45  gregf> Jakob_the_liar: sorry but I gotta get to bed, hope you figure out what caused that.
00:45  gregf> laters
00:45  Jakob_the_liar> alright thanks
00:45  Vinnonet> Thanks again, will check on that. :)

01:55  Garoth> Well, doesn't really matter
01:55  lesliesrussell> debian
01:55  Garoth> If you have 3.0, switching to the git development version and compiling yourself should be fairly trivial
01:55  Garoth> Well, on debian it's a touch harder, but should still be easy enough
01:55  Garoth> The Pope uses Debian, if I recall correctly 
01:56  lesliesrussell> is all the cool stuff with dynamic tabs etc in 3.1?
01:56  Garoth> Not yet.
01:56  Garoth> And, well, mind you, this is "3.1 RC1"
01:56  Garoth> As in Release Candidate 1, not final
01:56  Garoth> 3.0 went up to rc6
01:56  Garoth> Before being released.
01:57  Garoth> I don't know if he plans to put in more features.
01:57  Garoth> Anyway, if you start using the git version, you'll be getting changes as soon as they're merged, or sooner if you dare
01:57  lesliesrussell> oh ok
01:57  lesliesrussell> well I think i might just sit tight for a while
01:57  Garoth> I very much recommend using the version from source, but it is up to you.
01:58  lesliesrussell> i am still wading through lua conf etc
01:58  lesliesrussell> plus i dont think I am using all the features in 3.0 yet
01:58  Garoth> Well, fair enough then.
01:59  Garoth> Should probably understand the conf before you end up having to fix it due to API changes
01:59  lesliesrussell> i think i am getting close I am tinkering with it
01:59  Garoth> It's very tinkerable.
01:59  lesliesrussell> I wonder if you can give me a hint about something
01:59  Garoth> Certainly possible.

02:01  j:Error323:(~Error323@145-116-228-106.uilenstede.casema.nl)
02:01  Garoth> lesliesrussell: so you'll see in your default config that there is a theme that it's using
02:01  lesliesrussell> im thinking it is in the beatuifl config
02:01  Garoth> which, on my system, is: /usr/local/share/awesome/themes/default
02:02  lesliesrussell> yep yep
02:02  Garoth> So I recommend you copy that into .config/awesome
02:02  lesliesrussell> done
02:02  Garoth> Edit your rc.lua to point to your copy
02:02  Garoth> Then edit the file
02:02  lesliesrussell> and done
02:02  Garoth> I'll tell you which line to change... 1 sec
02:02  Garoth> Ah, yes
02:02  Garoth> border_focus of course
02:03  Garoth> lesliesrussell: so it's not that the default config doesn't do this already... it's just that it's hard to notice because the colour isn't very bright
02:03  Garoth> So change your border_focus colour to something bright -- you can figure that out?
02:04  lesliesrussell> OH OK!
02:04  lesliesrussell> Jeez what a dummy I am
02:04  Garoth> Nah, don't worry about it
02:05  Garoth> lesliesrussell: anyway, so this behaviour is actually written into your rc.lua, conveniently
02:05  q:Jakob_the_liar:(~complex@71-221-160-48.bois.qwest.net)
02:05  Garoth> You'll see that there is a section that starts with awful.hooks.focus.register(
02:05  Garoth> these "hooks" get called on certain actions
02:06  Garoth> This one gets called when a window gets focussed, and the variable passed in, c, is the client (window)
02:06  Garoth> So then he simply does c.border_color = beautiful.border_focus
02:06  Garoth> Which is the variable defined in beautiful
02:06  Garoth> Very tidy :)
02:06  lesliesrussell> much better than the old conf system
02:07  lesliesrussell> keep presentation seperate
02:07  Garoth> Well, it actually sort of fails at the moment
02:07  Garoth> But I've been annoying people in the right direction :)
02:07  lesliesrussell> how does it fail?
02:08  Garoth> I say it fails because icons aren't set in the theme files.
02:08  q:canen:(~canen@72.252.109.32)
02:08  Garoth> and the wallpaper is a special case.
02:08  lesliesrussell> oh yeah that would be better done in beautiful
02:08  lesliesrussell> and I understand why wallpaper is the way it is
02:08  Garoth> My theme, being a fairly radical departure from the default theme, requires new layout icons, new A button, etc
02:08  Garoth> So I needed this functionality in the theming
02:09  Garoth> Luckily, my hero, farhaven wrote it in today.
02:09  lesliesrussell> is that going in 3.1?
02:09  Garoth> Yep.
02:09  lesliesrussell> cool
02:09  Garoth> The Pope said my theme would be in 3.1, and this code is required for it.
02:09  lesliesrussell> one other question about Mod4
02:09  lesliesrussell> what are mouse buttons 3, 4, and 5
02:10  Garoth> Uhm... what does that have to do with Mod4? :)
02:10  lesliesrussell> my mouse only has 2 buttons and a scroll wheel
02:10  Garoth> Well, then you can't use buttons 3, 4, and 5 as far as I know
02:10  lesliesrussell> well they are used with mod4 in some settings
02:10  lesliesrussell> oh ok
02:10  lesliesrussell> so I can just remap those if I want
02:11  Garoth> Perhaps I should explain the keybinding syntax
02:11  Garoth> Yes, if you want
02:11  Garoth> Okay, so there are lines like...
02:11  Garoth> keybinding({ modkey }, "Escape", awful.tag.history.restore):add()
02:11  lesliesrussell> modkey is a var
02:11  Garoth> the list in the { } are the keys you must hold
02:11  lesliesrussell> ok
02:11  Garoth> the next bit is the button you must tap while holding them
02:11  lesliesrussell> sweet
02:11  Garoth> the next section is a _function pointer_
02:12  Garoth> Do you know what those are?
02:12  Garoth> And how they're different from fuctions?
02:12  lesliesrussell> not really
02:12  Garoth> Well, do you know pointers?
02:12  lesliesrussell> yes
02:12  lesliesrussell> i used them in c
02:12  Garoth> Okay, so functions are usually just something you call, right?
02:12  lesliesrussell> yes
02:12  Garoth> So that's kind of boring. What if you want to store which function should be called dynamically?
02:13  Garoth> So, like, what if you want a list that maps some strings to some functions to call?
02:13  Garoth> In a hashtable
02:13  Garoth> You can't do that with traditional functions
02:13  Garoth> So what they have are function pointers
02:13  Garoth> It's a way of passing functions like variables.
02:13  Garoth> So what you do is you pass a function into the keybinding so that it can be stored
02:13  lesliesrussell> yes
02:13  Garoth> And when the action happens, the function is called.
02:13  Garoth> Which is why you'll see stuff like
02:13  Garoth> keybinding({ modkey }, "Return", function () awful.util.spawn(terminal) end):add()
02:14  Garoth> What the syntax "function ()" means is that you're declaring an anonymous function
02:14  lesliesrussell> looks sort of like a perl oneliner
02:14  Garoth> Ie. a function without a name
02:15  Garoth> So you're declaring a function in one line, without a name. This returns a function pointer, which is passed to the function
02:15  Garoth> So the reason that they do this is so that they can pass args to the function they actually want run
02:15  Garoth> So see how it says util.spawn(terminal)
02:15  lesliesrussell> so you are passing the pointer to the keybinding
02:15  Garoth> Because usually the function pointer syntax reqires no arguments, this is a workaround
02:16  Garoth> Yes, you are passing the function pointer to the keybinding function
02:16  Garoth> Just keep in mind that if you want to make a keybinding that does more than one thing, or requires args to be passed, you can choose to use an anonymous function
02:16  q:Seb:(~Seb@75-101-3-16.dsl.dynamic.sonic.net)
02:17  Garoth> Anyway, that should clarify everything about why Mod4 is there and some of the stranger syntax required.
02:17  lesliesrussell> so what do end) and :add() do
02:17  Garoth> Well, end is required by lua functions
02:17  Garoth> That's how they delimit the end of a function
02:17  lesliesrussell> ok
02:17  lesliesrussell> sort of like fortran
02:17  Garoth> And about the :add()...
02:18  lesliesrussell> or cobol
02:18  Garoth> It's a bit complicated, but here is what's up
02:18  Garoth> keybinding() is a call to create a keybinding object
02:18  Garoth> Objects are able to have functions
02:19  Garoth> :add() is one such function, which takes the keybinding object that it's being used from and adds it to whatever database of them that exists in the code.
02:19  Garoth> That's my understanding, at least.
02:19  Garoth> In short, "you need it"
02:19  lesliesrussell> so you are dynamically creating a keybinding object with one anonymous function with a pointer to the actual function 
02:20  Garoth> Yep.
02:20  lesliesrussell> oh add() is like start up code
02:20  Garoth> Yep.
02:20  Garoth> And the reason that it's :add() instead of .add() is because it's an object using one of it's methods
02:20  Garoth> :add() is equal to .add(self)
02:21  lesliesrussell> add() must be inherited from somewhere upstream of the keybinding object right?
02:21  Garoth> No clue.
02:21  lesliesrussell> similar to java except we use : rather than .
02:22  Garoth> Well, uhm, we use both
02:22  lesliesrussell> oh ok
02:22  Garoth> Also, it's amazing that you know so many languages but have never heard of function pointers :)
02:22  lesliesrussell> oh no I have heard of function pointers
02:22  Garoth> Oh.
02:22  Garoth> Then...?
02:22  Garoth> Eh, whatever :)
02:22  lesliesrussell> something similar in pascal and c#
02:23  Garoth> Well, tbh, C has function pointers too
02:23  Garoth> if I recall correctly
02:23  lesliesrussell> I never really got that far into c
02:23  j:Evanlec:(~weechat@d-24-233-110-24.cpe.metrocast.net)
02:23  lesliesrussell> I mostly wrote business software on big iron using business languages
02:24  lesliesrussell> but we had function pointers there as well
02:24  Garoth> Hmm... business languages
02:24  lesliesrussell> yeah you know like cobol, fortran, RPG etc...
02:24  j:mkrist:(~mkrist@77.75.167.214)
02:24  Garoth> You must be really old :)
02:24  lesliesrussell> yes
02:25  Garoth> Well, sorry for the confusion then. I'm not sure why I was explaining function pointers.
02:25  Garoth> Anyway, anything unclear?
02:25  lesliesrussell> oh no I think i understand what is going on much better now
02:25  Garoth> Well, great :)
02:26  lesliesrussell> yeah what if I want to call a system object like say i wanna run something like "ls -l"
02:26  Garoth> I personally use popen for that... let me get an example
02:26  lesliesrussell> or if I want to set up a hot key to start synaptic
02:27  Garoth> I can help you there too
02:27  lesliesrussell> popen() and pass the command line as a parm?
02:27  Garoth> 1 sec
02:27  Garoth> Okay, so io.popen is part of the lua standard library, so it should be immediately available.
02:28  Garoth> What this does is run the command given, and return a file object that holds the output of the command run
02:28  Garoth> So, yes, if you just want to run a command: io.popen("synaptic") will work
02:28  Garoth> An example from my rc, though:
02:28  Garoth> file = io.popen("date +\"%I:%M %p on %A %B %e \"") 
02:28  Garoth> datetextbox.text = " " .. file:read()
02:28  lesliesrussell> does it return a sort of hash object that you can iterate through?
02:28  Garoth> So you can see there that I'm running the date command, and then using the output to create my date widget.
02:29  Garoth> lesliesrussell: yes.
02:29  lesliesrussell> nice
02:29  Garoth> I'm not sure about "hash" but it's certaintly a file reader object
02:29  Garoth> So if you want to make a binding to open a program...
02:29  lesliesrussell> some sort of linked list though
02:30  Garoth> keybinding({ modkey, "Shift" }, "s", function () io.popen("synaptic") end):add()
02:30  lesliesrussell> beautiful
02:30  Garoth> lesliesrussell: no idea what the internal representation is.
02:31  lesliesrussell> one last thing
02:31  Garoth> lesliesrussell: also, awesome provides a wrapper --
02:31  Garoth> keybinding({ modkey }, "Return", function () awful.util.spawn(terminal) end):add()
02:31  Garoth> Same idea, but ising awful.util.spawn and a variable.
02:31  Garoth> using*
02:31  Garoth> Instead of the lua std lib directly
02:32  lesliesrussell> do you get the access to the file reader object using the std lib
02:32  Garoth> the io module is from the standard lib, yes
02:32  lesliesrussell> cool
02:32  Garoth> But it's imported automatically.
02:32  Garoth> In fact, the entire lua std lib is available because it's so small
02:32  lesliesrussell> that sounds a better way to go
02:33  Garoth> Anyway, so with popen and some small understanding of how widgets are made (easy), awesome lets you write some scripts that monitor... stuff
02:33  Garoth> Like, if you're a sys admin, you can make it monitor your servers and output a nice report right in your wm
02:34  Garoth> At Xandros, I used it at one point to tell me the status of the debian package build system
02:34  lesliesrussell> this damned thing is amazing
02:34  Garoth> Yep, and you're allowed to have multiple wiboxes (ie statusbars)
02:34  Garoth> If you start to run out of room.
02:34  lesliesrussell> explain that one please
02:35  Garoth> Well, you know the "statusbar" -- that bar on the top of the screen?
02:35  lesliesrussell> yep
02:35  Garoth> That's what the source calls a "wibox" -- ie a "widget box"
02:35  lesliesrussell> ok
02:35  Garoth> It's a container which you can put widgets -- text, images, etc into
02:35  Garoth> So if you run out of room in your default one, you're allowed to have more wiboxes
02:35  Garoth> (or even if you don't run out of room :P )
02:36  lesliesrussell> so like one at the top one at the bottom sort of thing
02:36  Garoth> And then you can put the output of your scripts in your wiboxes to monitor stuff
02:36  Garoth> Yep
02:36  lesliesrussell> can the wiboxes float?
02:36  Garoth> or you can have two at the top
02:36  Garoth> Yep.
02:36  Garoth> Also, http://garoth.com/awesome/sky-theme.png
02:36  lesliesrussell> son-of-a-biatch LOL I was just joking WOW that is fantastic
02:37  Garoth> :)
02:37  Garoth> lesliesrussell: also, the menu that comes with 3.1 is implemented using wiboxes
02:37  Garoth> (ie, you can make awesome spawn menus when you click on stuff or whatever)
02:37  Garoth> And that's quite literally just floating wiboxes.
02:38  Garoth> (stacked on top of each other to look like a menu)
02:38  lesliesrussell> is there any way you can tell me where I can download some of those examples?
02:38  Garoth> Similarly, in 3.1, we have an implementation of Space Invaders using just moving wiboxes and images.
02:38  Garoth> lesliesrussell: examples of what?
02:38  Garoth> Oh, my examples?
02:38  lesliesrussell> well i'd love to see the code for that screenshot
02:39  Garoth> Sure, I could do that... but they'd probably be incompatible with your 3.0 :S
02:39  Garoth> Oh, that, sure
02:39  Garoth> lesliesrussell: you can literally have my whole config and theme if you want ;)
02:39  lesliesrussell> yeah I understand but I still love to see that as a learning tool
02:39  lesliesrussell> cool
02:39  Garoth> http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome-sky-theme.git;a=summary
02:39  Garoth> So I actually keep my theme + config in their own git repo there.
02:40  Garoth> lesliesrussell: http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome-sky-theme.git;a=blob_plain;f=rc.lua
02:40  Garoth> There is my config for example.
02:40  lesliesrussell> oh thats a great idea
02:41  Garoth> The only magic to do the panel on the left is:
02:41  Garoth>     statusbartop[s] = wibox({ position = "left", name = "statusbartop" .. s,
02:41  Garoth> You can give: position = "left" to your wibox
02:41  Garoth> It defaults to top, but you can override this way.
02:42  Garoth> I vaguely recall filing a bug againts position = left and right for 3.0 which has been fixed
02:42  Garoth> I can't really remember what it was
02:42  lesliesrussell> ok and it automatically handles the drawing of text vertically
02:42  Garoth> I think it was that it doesn't honour the size setting
02:42  Garoth> lesliesrussell: yes.
02:42  Garoth> And icons.
02:42  Garoth> It's brilliant :)
02:42  lesliesrussell> freakin sweet
02:42  lesliesrussell> gnome? what gnome?
02:42  Garoth> One thing it doesn't actually do at the moment is make a vertical wibox with horizontal elements...
02:42  lesliesrussell> LOL
02:43  Garoth> But The Pope promises that that is coming one day.
02:43  lesliesrussell> oh that would be cool
02:43  Garoth> Actually, gnome panel is embarrasing for this
02:44  lesliesrussell> i haven't touched gnome since I found 2.3
02:44  Garoth> If you have an image background for gnome panel and try to load it it vertically, it doesn't rotate the image and instead tiles it vertically...
02:44  lesliesrussell> and haven't missed it
02:44  Garoth> Oh, so did you get your brightly coloured focus border btw?
02:44  Garoth> lesliesrussell: you may also consider adjusting the border width if it's not enough.
02:45  lesliesrussell> yes got the code in but haven't Mod4+Shift+r yet
02:45  Garoth> Okay.
02:45  lesliesrussell> I am gonna go tinker
02:45  Garoth> Excellent :)
02:45  lesliesrussell> thanks for all the help
02:45  Garoth> Love to help
02:45  Garoth> Good luck.
02:45  lesliesrussell> one of these days I'll have to send you some cigars in appreciation
02:46  Garoth> Heh, I don't smoke, but I appreciate the idea :)
02:46  lesliesrussell> lol
02:46  lesliesrussell> well I really can't thank you enough
02:46  lesliesrussell> have a good evening

10:40  farhaven> hehe
10:41  Error323> is this some kind of fork?

10:42  farhaven> no, Garoth was so nice to give us a git repo
10:42  Error323> ah i c
10:42  farhaven> where we could place our stuff so jd could merge it easier
10:44  farhaven> btw... jd_: new commit at git.mercenariesguild.net/awesome invaders :)
10:44  farhaven> man
10:44  farhaven> i'm cranking out commits like crazy
10:44  Error323> lol invaders

10:45  Error323> btw, is this gitbrowser free?
10:45  farhaven> gitbrowser?
10:45  farhaven> the web interface, you mean?
10:45  Error323> can't run it here, am @ parents with windows -_-. ssh though
10:45  Error323> idd
10:46  Error323> farhaven: yes the web interface
10:46  farhaven> yeah, that's free
10:46  Error323> btw, what is naughty for?
10:46  Error323> cool
10:46  farhaven> it's called gitweb, i think
10:46  farhaven> naughty is for notifications
10:47  farhaven> like gnome with notification-daemon
10:48  Error323> ah i c.
10:49  Error323> mm weird, can't find it on aur
10:50  farhaven> gitweb?
10:50  Error323> idd
10:50  farhaven> i think it's part of git's standard distribution
10:50  farhaven> though i'm not sure
10:55  Error323> farhaven: ur correct
10:55  Error323> it was already on my computer lol
10:56  farhaven> lol
10:56  Error323> i tihnk i'm gonna use git as standard aswell
10:56  Error323> rlly like it's features 
10:56  farhaven> yeah, git totally rocks
10:56  Error323> but the commandnames aren't always as intuiitive imo
10:57  farhaven> well, it takes some time to get used to, but with a working bash completition for git, it's not that bad :)
10:57  stillunknown> What good does bash completion do for command arguments?
10:58  farhaven> well...
10:58  farhaven> it completes them
10:58  stillunknown> git-foo is gone
10:58  stillunknown> only git foo works these days
10:58  farhaven> so for example to rebase, i only need to type git re<tab> or<tab>/ma<tab>
10:58  farhaven> yeah, exactly, and completition completes the commandline arguments
10:59  farhaven> or for pushing to a certain branch, i don't need to type +beautiful, but only +b<tab>
10:59 @jd_> farhaven: here
11:00  farhaven> thx, i have new commits on mercenariesguild.net
11:00  stillunknown> per-branch pushing, hmm, i always thought you do the whole repo at once
11:00  farhaven> three in the beautiful branch, one in the invaders branch
11:00 @jd_> ok
11:00  farhaven> thx
11:00  farhaven> stillunknown: yeah well, but sometimes it's better to push to a branch than to overwrite the master branch of a remote repo

11:02  stillunknown> farhaven: Don't you have a tracking branch set up, that automatically goes to the right origin?
11:02  farhaven> HOT
11:02  Error323> though awesome should keep its clean code and style promis me that guys plz :x
11:02  Error323> at all times
11:02  farhaven> stillunknown: no, i just cloned the master branch from naquadah
11:02  Error323> don't make it blow up ^_^
11:02  farhaven> and everytime i want to change something, i pull master from origin
11:03  farhaven> then branch, do my stuff and push to mercenariesguild.net
11:03  farhaven> after rebasing
11:03  farhaven> though most of the time, i just use git reset + git cherry-pick instead of automatic rebasing
11:03  stillunknown> Anyone here good at finding memory leaks (not in awesome, don't worry)?
11:03  farhaven> valgrind is :)
11:04  stillunknown> yes, but that doesn't immediatly tell you how to fix it
11:05  stillunknown> The leak in cairo-xcb was easy to find, but the one if fontconfig is not so easy.
11:06  farhaven> just spread a bunch of if(p != NULL) free(p); all over the code :)

12:18  bavardage> hmm?
12:18  bavardage> worked fine for me?
12:18  farhaven> mmh, i should lean dvorak, too
12:18  bavardage> I think
12:18  bavardage> farhaven: yeah, you should :P?
12:18  bavardage> s/?/!/
12:18  farhaven> :D
12:18  bavardage> makes it even more hilarious when someone asks to use my laptop
12:19  bavardage> they have to contend with linux, awesome and dvorak
12:19  bavardage> and vimperator
12:19  tychoish> lol
12:19  tychoish> how does vim convert to dvorak
12:20  adammichael> i meant, i had run it without adding & then i do ctrl+z :P
12:20  erikg> so i'm a bit confused why the expose managing in xcompmgr doesn't work under awesome
12:20  erikg> because the drop shadows, fade effect, etc. all work
12:20  erikg> is it something to do with xcb + awesome beating xcompmgr to the expose events?
12:21  erikg> bavardage: i've been living in that place for a long time
12:21  tychoish> so bavardage, dovorak questions is there a good dovorak typing tutor, and is the left-handed stuff a problem? 
12:21  erikg> tychoish: dvorak7min is probably enough to get started
12:21  erikg> tychoish: and i find that the hands are very balanced, although you tend to do different kinds of things with each
12:22  bavardage> uuuhmm
12:22  bavardage> left handed tutor?
12:22  bavardage> *left handed problem?
12:22  bavardage> and I didn't use a tutor or anything
12:22  tychoish> I mean, isn't there a dvorak layout for lefties?
12:22  bavardage> tychoish: probably
12:22  tychoish> bavardage: I'm not as hardcore as you ;)
12:22  bavardage> :D
12:23  bavardage> I just switched my keyboard layout to dvorak, and typed like a retard for 2 months or so
12:23  tychoish> lol
12:23  bavardage> I thought that unless I threw out qwerty completely, I wouldn't actually bother learning dvorak
12:23  j:Rasi_:(~carnager@e181167184.adsl.alicedsl.de)
12:24  tychoish> I mean, I'm pretty prolific as a writer, and a pretty damn good typist, but I'd need to get to like... 50wpm in like 3 days, and that's always seemed like a challenge 
12:25  bavardage> hmm?
12:25  bavardage> whyL
12:25  bavardage> *?
12:25  bavardage> and I'm sure I'm a fairly mediochre typist
12:25  bavardage> *mediocre 
12:25  erikg> tychoish: there is a dvorak layout for people with only a left or a right hand
12:25  tychoish> I mean, my accuracy isn't *great* but that's my inability to spell more than my typing ability
12:25  bavardage> only ever done one test, and that was like 80wpm
12:25  bavardage> tychoish: yeah know the feeling
12:26  erikg> typeracer.com
12:26  tychoish> erikg: you mean. like *only* a left hand
12:26  adammichael> brb
12:26  q:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
12:26  erikg> yes, with *only* one hand
12:26  tychoish> oh
12:26  tychoish> well, that's good, I've had nightmares about loosing a hand 
12:26  erikg> as in they lost the other when they tried to wrestle with an alligator or rabid squirrel
12:26  tychoish> I'm with you
12:27  erikg> so my problems with typing after switching to dvorak are problems with the overall structure of the keyboards which i use
12:27  tychoish> what do you mean?
12:27  j:jonkristian:(~jonkristi@240.80-202-222.nextgentel.com)
12:27  erikg> for instance, having the return key on the right hand side, and having to hit it with the pinky
12:27  tychoish> dear new awesome users 
12:27  erikg> that is crack.  i am so tired of using 19th century tech for computer interaction.
12:27  bavardage> pfft that website is annoying
12:28  erikg> bavardage: typeracer.com?
12:28  bavardage> yeah
12:28  erikg> we play that at work a lot
12:28  bavardage> doesn't let you just keep typing
12:28  bavardage> you gotta correct errors as they happen
12:28  bavardage> like if you miss out commas etc
12:28  tychoish> please run irc in screen so when x dies you don't drop off line
12:28  j:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
12:29  bavardage> w00t
12:29  bavardage> I won!
12:29  bavardage> 85wpm
12:29  bavardage> ownage
12:29  erikg> bavardage: ah, yeah it has problems
12:29  tychoish> so your complaint with dvorak is that modifier/function keys are around the edges of the keyboard?
12:29  bavardage> the others on here are slow it seems :P
12:29  erikg> tychoish: that's my complaint with *all* keyboards now
12:29  q:Rasi:(~carnager@85.182.50.135)
12:29  erikg> also... the key layout on 'modern' keyboards is based on mechanical keyboards
12:30  erikg> so we have these silly offsets between the keys
12:30  adammichael> I'm curious what terminal (xterm or so on) is used commonly in awesomewm setups
12:30  erikg> which only would make sense if there were mechanical arms dropping down from the keys
12:30  *** erikg just uses xterm
12:30  bavardage> pfft 2nd with 87
12:30  bavardage> THIS IS ADDICTIVE
12:30  bavardage> erikg: I HATE YOU
12:30  erikg> hehe
12:30  *** erikg avoids such addictions
12:30  *** adammichael is using xterm as well
12:31  erikg> yeah, stock xterm configuration works perfectly on my laptop
12:31  erikg> i get two columns of 80 chars
12:31  tychoish> I got 74 on my first 
12:31  q:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
12:31  tychoish> I use terminator, which is very gnomey but it's pretty and it works
12:31  bavardage> anyone want a race ^^ :P?
12:32  erikg> anyone with any insight into why xlib-based composite managers seem to break on awesome?
12:32  j:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
12:32  erikg> is it a race condition between xcb-based stuff and xlib-based stuff?
12:32  q:uzsolt:(~uzsolt@catv4E5C8506.pool.t-online.hu)
12:32  *** erikg is confused
12:32  adammichael> is there a way to have translucent xterms?
12:33  erikg> you could probably use a composite manager, actually
12:33  adammichael> xcompmgr?
12:33  erikg> the transparency stuff and drop shadow stuff works
12:33  erikg> yeah, fade ins work
12:33  erikg> but exposition and damage management fail :(  which kind've limits the usefulness of it
12:33  erikg> so i'm thinking of writing a xcb-based composite manager
12:34  erikg> but i'm confused as to exactly why the exposition stuff is breaking
12:34  stillunknown> On a sidenote, xcompmgr is not garuanteed to be bug free.
12:34  erikg> stillunknown: are you referring to Z algebra?
12:35  stillunknown> No.
12:35  erikg> hehe
12:35  erikg> you just mean it might have bugs
12:36  stillunknown> I'm just saying there are reports floating around of xcompmgr not being perfect.
12:36  erikg> hmmmm
12:36  stillunknown> (reports not literally meaning bug reports)
12:36  bavardage> erikg: go and write one :P
12:36  bavardage> erikg: linux needs an active xcompmgr
12:36  bavardage> as in, a developed lightweight composite manager
12:37  erikg> yeah
12:37  erikg> bavardage: frankly the functionality i actually want is pretty limited
12:37  bavardage> xcompmgr is fairly undeveloper iirc
12:37  bavardage> erikg: go go go
12:37  bavardage> write one :P
12:37  stillunknown> It's abandoned.
12:37  erikg> hehe, before starting i gotta know why it is that awesome and xmonad interact so horribly with it
12:37  erikg> i just want to understand the problem
12:37  adammichael> what is exposition?
12:37  bavardage> or just get coding :P
12:38  erikg> adammichael: so run xev
12:38  bavardage> you have any idea how to write one?
12:38  bavardage> also, what do you mean by horribly?
12:38  erikg> bavardage: yeah, i just read xcompmgr.  it's surprisingly uncomplicated
12:38  bavardage> heh nice
12:38  erikg> adammichael: now move xev off the screen, and onto the screen
12:38  bavardage> I can't read C :|
12:38  erikg> you'll seee exposition events...
12:38  erikg> bavardage: ah, so what i mean by 'breaks'
12:39  bavardage> I used to get funky inteference patterns when apps were loading, if you mean that?
12:39  erikg> the main thing that composition is supposed to do is manage a tree of offscreen buffers so that when windows are pushed offscreen/out of view they don't have to get unmapped
12:39  erikg> and when they come back on the screen they don't have to get mapped again
12:39  stillunknown> erikg: what's the precise problem with xcompmgr?
12:39  erikg> because that takes processing power
12:39  erikg> stillunknown: the precise problem with xcompmgr is that it does not seem to be managing the mapping of windows under awesome
12:39  adammichael> i dont really care about fading in/out windows/etc
12:40  erikg> nor do i
12:40  adammichael> just want transparency on xterms :P
12:40  erikg> i just want to trade RAM for responsiveness
12:40  erikg> hehe
12:40  erikg> stillunknown: does that make sense?
12:40  erikg> stillunknown: you can try it out.  run xcompmgr in a terminal.  now switch tags to, say... firefox
12:40  erikg> you'll note that it re-renders itself
12:40  erikg> it shouldn't.  that's the point of composition
12:41  LarstiQ> right, makes sense.
12:41  erikg> it should be rendering to an offscreen buffer all the time, and when its window is exposed the composite manager should punt the buffer to the screen without asking for a remap operation
12:41  LarstiQ> erikg: unfortunately, I have no clue why that is broken.
12:41  erikg> but when running xcompmgr under awesome it doesn't behave properly
12:41  erikg> LarstiQ: :)  of course.  nor do i
12:41  tychoish> so we'd be using a lot of system resources to make half a second look a little smoother? 
12:41  j:sm217:(~sm@94.178.3.202)
12:41  erikg> my hunch is that something is racing between the xcb-based wm's and the xlib-based composite manager
12:42  erikg> tychoish: well it would be instantaneous
12:42  bavardage> so is it possible to write a xcb-based composite manager?
12:42  erikg> tychoish: on an underpowerd system you could save seconds every time you switch windows
12:42  erikg> bavardage: of course :)  all the extensions are there
12:42  LarstiQ> tychoish: mno, the difference is rather big
12:42  erikg> i'm just loathe to do it if the problem is something that can be fixed in xcompmgr
12:42  erikg> or in awesome
12:42  bavardage> erikg: so how long before you've got an alpha :P?
12:43  erikg> but if it's an xcb vs. xlib race condition
12:43  erikg> bavardage: probably about 8 hours from when i start working
12:43  erikg> because we're just talking about porting the app to use the xcb library
12:43  erikg> i'm just talking.... not about rewriting it from scratch
12:43  stillunknown> Even automatic redirection exposes again.
12:43  erikg> stillunknown: yeah, on xcompmgr
12:44  erikg> i think it may actually be a problem with awesome.  that's why i'm not jumping at this
12:44  bavardage> erikg: so get to work :P?
12:44  stillunknown> But automatic redirection is like changing a flag.
12:44  bavardage> hurry hurry
12:44  erikg> i'm sure the xcb composition manager would be slightly better in performance and probably latency...
12:44  stillunknown> It all happens inside the xserver.
12:44  erikg> stillunknown: hm.  let me check the source
12:45  q:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
12:46  erikg> stillunknown: yeah.  so i'm super confused by this
12:46  erikg> stillunknown: it looks like exactly as you describe
12:46  bavardage> so you're confused why awesome doesn't work with composite
12:47  erikg> bavardage: sure.  got a magic secret?
12:47  stillunknown> erikg: I think i found the problem.
12:47  erikg> stillunknown: dime
12:47  bavardage> erikg: I have many magic secrets
12:47  bavardage> none of which will I tell you
12:47  bavardage> pfft that was an unwieldy sentence
12:47  stillunknown> erikg: The layouts rearrange all clients upon tag switch.
12:47  erikg> stillunknown: for a laugh check out the behavior of the gimp windows when you tweak the -a flag
12:48  erikg> stillunknown: ahha
12:48  stillunknown> Which includes a resize request.
12:48  erikg> hehe
12:48  erikg> whoop
12:48  bavardage> and rearranging causes a redraw?
12:48  stillunknown> There is nothing to tweak about automatic redirection.
12:48  erikg> stillunknown: i mean the automatic redirection doesn't behave very well
12:48  j:t3rror2:(~root@adsl-074-236-251-094.sip.owb.bellsouth.net)
12:49  bavardage> Ima go eat
12:49  erikg> stillunknown: so what do you think we can do?
12:49  bavardage> bbl
12:49  bavardage> good luck
12:49  q:bavardage:(~bavardage@87.114.163.96.plusnet.thn-ag1.dyn.plus.net)
12:49  LarstiQ> erikg: the effect is nicely noticeable on firefox if you have it on more than one tag with different sizes, switching between tags will scroll the firefox tabs like mad :)
12:50  stillunknown> erikg: Question why a resize that changes nothing gets through.
12:50  stillunknown> even wonder if it gets through at all
12:51  erikg> got a code pointer?
12:51  stillunknown> client.c around 600
12:52  erikg> ok
12:53  erikg> hm
12:53  erikg> where does this get hit?
12:53  erikg> client_resize
12:54  stillunknown> checkout some of the layouts
12:54  stillunknown> like layouts/tile.c
12:55  erikg> i'm there
12:55  erikg> layouts/fair.c:                client_resize(c, geometry, c->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> layouts/fibonacci.c:            client_resize(c, geometry, c->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> layouts/floating.c:            client_resize(c, c->f_geometry, false);
12:55  erikg> layouts/magnifier.c:    client_resize(focus, geometry, focus->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> layouts/magnifier.c:            client_resize(c, geometry, c->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> layouts/max.c:            client_resize(c, area, false);
12:55  erikg> layouts/tile.c:            client_resize(c, geometry, c->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> layouts/tile.c:            client_resize(c, geometry, c->honorsizehints);
12:55  erikg> whoops.  that was more lines than i thought ;)
12:57  erikg> stillunknown: look at 45 in tag.c
12:59  stillunknown> give it a try
13:02  stillunknown> (away)
13:03  stillunknown> although, the need arrange might be used to view the new applications.
13:03  erikg> right.  well i'm gonna see what breaks
13:03  ~:vcgomes[away] >> vcgomes
13:04  *** erikg builds
13:05  erikg> humorously, right as i thought about changing that line my computer crashed
13:05  erikg> silly intrepid ibex
13:05  erikg> this is what i get for volunteering for the free software movement.  two steps forward one step back
13:12  drone77> aww erikg that's a little unfair, some of it may be backwards but it's at least moving forward
13:12  tychoish> that's what he said. 2 forward and one back = one forward 
13:12  rbistolfi> lol
13:12  drone77> i'm so used to those words in another order
13:12  tychoish> intrepid is ok
13:13  drone77> that i just read it that way
13:13  erikg> stillunknown: looks like it's not so simple as killing that line ;)
13:13  tychoish> I'm too lazy to use anything else
13:13  stillunknown> erikg: I realised that already :-)
13:13  erikg> hehe
13:13  erikg> stillunknown: it was more fun to break things
13:14  erikg> so the theory is that we need to avoid the resize events when nothing has changed
13:14  stillunknown> Indeed.
13:14  erikg> at present we are just issuing them willy-nilly
13:14  erikg> that is not hard.  we just have to check the window size and positioning.
13:14  stillunknown> But that already happens :-|
13:14  erikg> ah!
13:14  erikg> i should read better
13:14  drone77> join the club
13:15  erikg> stillunknown: wait, where are we checking that?
13:15  stillunknown> in client_resize
13:15  stillunknown> it checks against the current geometry.
13:17  erikg> i'm just seeing a check for if the window is fixed && ...
13:18  stillunknown> and also if dimensions changes
13:18  stillunknown> *changed
13:19  stillunknown> Anyway, comparing dwm and awesome revealed one major difference.
13:19  stillunknown> dwm moves windows out of sight
13:19  stillunknown> awesome unmaps them
13:19  j:micr0c0sm:(~micr0c0sm@ool-45717c43.dyn.optonline.net)
13:19  erikg> interesting
13:20  stillunknown> you should check out layout.c
13:20  stillunknown> and read arrange
13:20  stillunknown> and read ban_client
13:20  stillunknown> client_ban i mean
13:20  erikg> right
13:21  erikg> hehe, unmap_window
13:21  iamFIREcracker> is there anyone using xcalendar?
13:21  tychoish> iamFIREcracker: nope but I'm interested
13:21  erikg> iamFIREcracker: sometimes i use xeyes
13:21  erikg> when i'm feeling lonely
13:21  tychoish> lol
13:21  iamFIREcracker> tychoish: i've done a port of it using python + gtk
13:22  iamFIREcracker> i'm looking for testers :d
13:22  erikg> stillunknown: i see.  and dwm just moves the windows off the visible screen?
13:22  stillunknown> erikg: yes
13:22  tychoish> iamFIREcracker: tell me what I need to do
13:22  erikg> interesting
13:22  erikg> i think the explicit unmap is probably what's hurting
13:22  iamFIREcracker> http://github.com/iamFIREcracker/gcalendar/tree/master
13:22  stillunknown> I have to go.
13:22  stillunknown> good luck
13:22  erikg> stillunknown: thank
13:22  erikg> thanks.  you helped a lot
13:23  iamFIREcracker> you simpli have to type make install for placing it in the right place
13:24  iamFIREcracker> erikg: what about xeyes? is it for following the cursor movement?

14:08  badger> no, make me some!
14:10  bavardage> NO ME
14:10  jt_> YA U
14:11  farhaven> WAT?
14:13  jt_> MOUNTAIN FACE
14:13  jt_> YOU FAILED
14:13  jt_> HE KNOWS IT
14:13  farhaven> WATEVER!
14:16  Garoth> bavardage: huh?
14:17  bavardage> ooh hai
14:17  bavardage> Fancy making some graphics :P?
14:18  Garoth> Enough with the :P, :P
14:18  Garoth> I'd need a bit more info please
14:19  bavardage> screenie coming
14:19  bavardage> and :P owns
14:19  bavardage> or I could do :Þ if you'd prefer
14:20  bavardage> http://omploader.org/vd21w <-- the speaker icon, a muted speaker icon, and 20 bars of increasing height, 2 of each size in 2 colours
14:21  pyrho> bavardage: omg is that "real fake-transparency" ?
14:21  pyrho> on your top statusbar ?
14:21  bavardage> pyrho: indeed :D
14:21  pyrho> and below is that a minimized window ?
14:21  pyrho> how do you do both ? :D
14:22  bavardage> hmm minimized window?
14:22  pyrho> I heard about minimizing but didn't find the binding
14:22  bavardage> hhmm?
14:22  bavardage> no minimised window anywhere
14:22  pyrho> ow
14:22  pyrho> then ooooo
14:22  pyrho> it's the tasklist in the bottom statusbar
14:22  pyrho> ok (:
14:22  jt_> pyrho: in your beautiful config, add 00,11,22,etc to the end of the bg and fg colors
14:23  pyrho> rgba format
14:23  pyrho> ?
14:23  Garoth> It's possible to minimez
14:23  Garoth> minimize*
14:23  jt_> like #333333, and put 55 at the end to make 50% trans.
14:24  bavardage> FAIL
14:24  pyrho> Garoth: but how, i did find the binding in the default cfg, did I not look properly ?
14:24  bavardage> it's not 55, surely
14:24  bavardage> *goes to check hexadecimal*
14:24  Garoth> pyrho: there is a default binding?
14:24  jt_> whatever. you know what I meant
14:24  bavardage> yup, is 80 for 50%
14:24  bavardage> </pedant>
14:24  Garoth> keybinding({ modkey, "Shift" }, "m", function () client.focus.minimize=true end):add()
14:25  pyrho> Garoth: since I didn't find it, i don't think so (:
14:25  Garoth> I don't know what you meant, but there is my bind
14:25  pyrho> Garoth: I meant in /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua
14:25  Garoth> uhm... w/e
14:25  pyrho> Garoth: thanks :)
14:25  Garoth> Just use what I pasted
14:25  Garoth> :)
14:25  pyrho> btw what does "w/e" mean ?
14:25  bavardage> whatever
14:25  Garoth> "whatever"
14:25  tychoish> whatever
14:26  bavardage> you got 3 answers :D
14:26  pyrho> ok ok :)
14:26  tychoish> I like that Garoth was the only one to use quotes
14:26  bavardage> 'cos he's the sophisticated one, ain't it
14:27  Garoth> bavardage: any particular colour scheme?
14:27  bavardage> Garoth: no clue
14:27  bavardage> w/e
14:27  Garoth> Like "blend into the default"?
14:27  bavardage> vaguely neutral I guess is best
14:27  pyrho> Garoth: client.focus:minimized=not client.focus:minimized    would be better no ?
14:27  farhaven> Garoth: did you have a look at the log from git.naquadah.org/awesome ?
14:27  farhaven> i think you'll be happy when you read it :)
14:27  Garoth> pyrho: no, because how do you have a focussed window that's minimized?
14:28  Garoth> farhaven: 1 sec
14:30  pyrho> Garoth: true, but then there's no way to un-minimize a window w/o (<- hehe) the mouse ?
14:30  Garoth> pyrho: you could do it, but I haven't
14:31  pyrho> Garoth: how could you ? 
14:32  Garoth> You'd search the current tag's clients for minimized ones
14:32  q:farhaven:(~gregor@Qe654.q.pppool.de)
14:32  Garoth> And unminimize one
14:32  pyrho> that's what i tought, but then if you have more than 1 minimized window it wouldn't work
14:32  bavardage> you could make a widgety thing on taskbar
14:32  j:farhaven:(~gregor@Qe654.q.pppool.de)
14:32  pyrho> it would but not properly
14:32  bavardage> that lists minimised windows
14:32  pyrho> bavardage: good idea
14:32  bavardage> and assigns keybindings on-the-fly to unminimise
14:33  bavardage> actually don't need on the fly
14:33  pyrho> but I think the best would be being able to cycle on minimized windows
14:33  bavardage> just do some-key-combo + 0-9 to unminimise window 'n' in the list
14:33  pyrho> i mean as if they were not minimized
14:42  pyrho> w00t naughty rocks 8)
14:42  pyrho> just saw this
14:42  Garoth> Yep.
14:43  pyrho> anyone has "examples" of configs using this ?
14:43  Garoth> You don't need much
14:43  Garoth> pyrho: do you have the source?
14:43  pyrho> checking the API doc
14:44  Garoth> pyrho: do you have the source?
14:44  pyrho> but yes I do (was looking at the code for that hidden -> no cycle thing)
14:44  pyrho> take it easy :P !
14:44  Garoth> Okay, so -- head -n  20 lib/naughty.lua.in
14:44  Garoth> That'll explain stuff.
14:44  pyrho> k ty
14:45  farhaven> jd_: i have a little bugfix on git://git.mercenariesguild.net/awesome invaders
14:45  Garoth> farhaven: oh, hi
14:45  farhaven> hey :)
14:45  Garoth> Thanks for all your efforts
14:45  Garoth> But there is one more thing I'd like fixed
14:45  farhaven> tell me
14:45  Garoth> I'd like it to theme the A icon as well
14:45  Garoth> And this breaks when I try it
14:46  farhaven> hmm
14:46  Garoth> (error from awful.widget, 363)
14:46  farhaven> actually that would just be one changed line in awesomerc.lua
14:46  Garoth> 2 lines
14:46  Garoth> And it doesn't work
14:46  farhaven> mmh, i'll try it
14:46  Garoth> (that icon is referernced twice)
14:46  farhaven> such a bitch :D
14:46  Garoth> I can't figure out what's wrong
14:46  Garoth> (I tried to look at it)
14:47  farhaven> i'll have a look at it
14:47  Garoth> It works for the menu, but not for the button type widget
14:47  Gigamo> so the default awesome theme is now garoth's?
14:47  Garoth> Gigamo: no:)
14:47  Garoth> We'll just be packaging mine as an alternate
14:47  farhaven> Garoth: in which line is the button type widget defined?
14:48  farhaven> line 110 ?
14:48  Garoth> Yes
14:48  Garoth> 110
14:48  Garoth> A few lines up, the menu one does work with the new theme stuff
14:48  Garoth> But this one doesn't strangely
14:48  farhaven> mmh
14:50  farhaven> ah, i know why
14:50  farhaven> the launcher is actually a button
14:50  Garoth> Yes.
14:50  farhaven> which uses a textbox to display the icon
14:50  farhaven> not an imagebox
14:50  Garoth> Hmm...
14:50  Garoth> But... isn't it just strings passed?
14:50  farhaven> so in theory, you should be fine with changing the image to a normal beautiful definition
14:51  farhaven> yeah, the launcher function gets a path passed
14:51  farhaven> which it uses to create pango markup for the button
14:51  farhaven> to make this "button pressed" effect possible
14:51  Garoth> So... shouldn't that work?
14:51  farhaven> no, because awful.beautiful.get_image actually returns an image object
14:51  Garoth> Oh.
14:52  Garoth> Maybe it shouldn't?
14:52  Garoth> Everything is strings in my rc.lua
14:52  farhaven> if it doesn't, it's up to the user to check whether a correct image was returned
14:52  Garoth> I'm okay with that
14:53  farhaven> mmh
14:53  Garoth> Or, if you want, get_image_path?
14:53  farhaven> that'd be an idea
14:53  Garoth> Or does the img object have a .path?
14:54  farhaven> i don't think so
14:54  Garoth> Kinda hacky, but... meh
14:54  Garoth> :)
14:54  farhaven> as far as i know, it is just a pointer to image data
14:54  farhaven> :)
14:54  Garoth> Up to you
14:55  farhaven> the question would be, what would happen if you pass nil to image()
14:55  Garoth> A big error; your fault for being an idiot
14:55  farhaven> yeah, makes sense
14:55  farhaven> so, get_image_path would still be overkill, i think
14:56  Garoth> +1
14:56  farhaven> after all, you could just use beautiful.launcher_img or whatever you called the menu logo
14:57  farhaven> so, what was the name you gave it?
14:59  Garoth> Idk, awesome_icon
15:00  farhaven> then maybe just adapting the default awesomerc.lua to grab that image directly from beautiful would be the best solution here
15:00  Garoth> Uhm... yes?
15:01  Garoth> But I don't know how that's possible
15:02  farhaven> i think replacing line #110 with mylauncher = awful.widget.launcher({ image = beautiful.awesome_icon, would be enough
15:03  Garoth> farhaven: try it, last I tried, it failed
15:03  farhaven> with that syntax?
15:03  Garoth> Which is why I needed your code to begin with
15:03  Garoth> Yes.
15:03  farhaven> weird stuff, as that's basically what my code does
15:04  Garoth> Hmm.
15:04  Garoth> farhaven: give it a try and see if I'm crazy?
15:05  farhaven> yep
15:05  q:iamFIREcracker:(~qwerty@host-78-12-101-221.cust-adsl.tiscali.it)
15:06  farhaven> hmm
15:06  farhaven> if I replace both occurences of the icon with beautiful.awesome_icon, everything works fine
15:06  Garoth> Oh, okay
15:06  Garoth> Sweet.
15:06  farhaven> looks like both launcher and menu take a path rather than image data
15:08  Garoth> Uhm, the menu was okay with the image data
15:08  j:iamFIREcracker:(~qwerty@78.13.147.49)
15:08  Garoth> farhaven: $
15:08  Garoth> ^*
15:08  farhaven> k, then the menu can cope with both
15:09  Garoth> farhaven: anyway, please commit your changes
15:09  farhaven> yep
15:09  farhaven> i'll just run some tests before

15:15  tron> on the bright side I have awesome running on dual screen on a macbook pro
15:15  farhaven> i can't seem to get it to work here
15:16  farhaven> tron: macos or linux?
15:16  tron> linux
15:16  tron> arch
15:16  Garoth> farhaven: huh?
15:16  farhaven> try as i might, i can't get the icon to show up with image data
15:16  Garoth> Uhm...
15:16  farhaven> maybe i made some big mistake
15:18  Garoth> mymainmenu = awful.menu.new({ items = { { "awesome", myawesomemenu, awful.beautiful.get_image("awesome_icon")},
15:18  Garoth>                                         { "open terminal", terminal }

15:22  Garoth> Pushing in features :)
15:22  Garoth> Better than validating bugs
15:22  farhaven> crazy people coming to me all the time, wanting their code merged :)

15:26  farhaven> some days ago they aired starship troopers, one of those rare highlights :)
15:28  Garoth> Hahaha
15:29  farhaven> yup
15:29  farhaven> sucks to be german
15:30  mkrist> what?
15:30  mkrist> I disagree :)
15:30  farhaven> being german sucks
15:30  farhaven> why that?
15:30  mkrist> I like German
15:30  farhaven> because we have a working economy and healthcare system? XD
15:30  mkrist> Oh, I'm from Denmark
15:30  mkrist> ;)
15:30  mkrist> We have that at the same level as you I guess
15:31  farhaven> hehe, our neighbour in the north
15:31  farhaven> yeah, i'd guess so
15:31  mkrist> Which you never notice :P
15:31  farhaven> :)
15:31  mkrist> I'm going to change that some day
15:31  farhaven> being danish or us noticing you?
15:31  mkrist> latter
15:31  farhaven> how?
15:31  farhaven> waging war?
15:31  farhaven> that'd be cool :D
15:32  mkrist> Coming to Germany and making a lot of noise
15:32  farhaven> hehe
15:32  mkrist> I wouldn't want to be enemies with the Bundeswehr lol
15:33  farhaven> yeah, we'd kick your ass :)
15:33  mkrist> Definitely
15:33  farhaven> btw. i'm having my medical examination for military service next friday
15:33  mkrist> Maybe considering 80M against 5-6M people ;)
15:33  farhaven> but... i don't want some old woman to touch my nuts :(
15:33  mkrist> Oh why not?
15:33  mkrist> That's the best part of it
15:33  farhaven> lol
15:33  farhaven> better than some old guy, i guess
15:34  mkrist> Maybe not
15:34  mkrist> If you get a hardon
15:34  farhaven> from an old woman touching my genitals`
15:34  farhaven> i hope not
15:34  tron> lol
15:34  mkrist> Wouldn't have been the first time it happened, I can assure you
15:35  farhaven> hehe
15:35  mkrist> In Denmark we are left with the boxers on :)
15:35  farhaven> lucky you :9
15:35  farhaven> *:)
15:35  mkrist> Only thing he groped was my knee I guess
15:35  mkrist> and back
15:36  farhaven> how long did the examination take?
15:36  farhaven> i heard 5 to 6 hours is usual
15:36  mkrist> Is military service compulsory in Germany?
15:36  mkrist> Well, the medical examination exclusively only took 10 minutes
15:36  mkrist> But there's a lot of information and waiting as well
15:36  farhaven> k
15:36  farhaven> well, it's kind of compulsory
15:36  mkrist> 5-6 hours is definitely the max
15:37  farhaven> you can deny military service, but then you have to do civilan service
15:37  farhaven> like red cross or THW
15:37  mkrist> And that goes for every single guy?
15:37  farhaven> yep
15:37  farhaven> only disabled guys are sorted out
15:37  mkrist> In Denmark it's kind of a lottery
15:37  farhaven> or people who have two older brothers who served
15:38  mkrist> You pick a number from a container and only some of us are doing the service :P
15:38  farhaven> lol
15:38  mkrist> And it's really limitied nowadays how many they need
15:38  mkrist> I drew a good number :)
15:38  farhaven> hehe
15:38  mkrist> Well, would definitely have done it, but I'd rather just get on with my education
15:39  farhaven> yeah, i hope i get sorted out, too
15:39  farhaven> but i think allergies is not enough :(
15:39  mkrist> How long is it?
15:39  farhaven> 9 month
15:39  mkrist> oh :/
15:39  mkrist> Allergies are definitely not enough
15:39  farhaven> but you can also do 6 month + 2 times 6 weeks
15:39  farhaven> damn :)
15:39  mkrist> But good luck from here :P
15:39  farhaven> hehe, thanks :)
15:40  mkrist> Where in Germany are you from?
15:40  Gigamo> im so glad they removed that law in belgium
15:40  Gigamo> :P
15:40  farhaven> mkrist: NRW

15:42  bavardage> pyrho: 'Klock' from adesklets
15:42  bavardage> mkrist: wir können Deutsch sprechen, wenn du willst
15:42  mkrist> Naja, ist mir egal :)
15:43  pyrho> bavardage: and it's "on your wallpaper" ?
15:43  bavardage> aber ich werde oft kein Sinn machen

15:45  mkrist> farhaven, bah, lots of Danish people speak German :P
15:45  eyolf> pyrho: a fellow archer, I can tell?
15:45  mkrist> No okay, you're forgiven :P

15:46  eyolf> :)
15:47  Garoth> Arch
15:47  eyolf> how many awesomers are archers? seems like a high percentage
15:48  Garoth> It is high
15:48  pyrho> looks like
15:48  eyolf> or to put it the other way around: are there anyone on ubuntu here..? :)
15:48  Garoth> Probably the biggest distro representation 
15:49  eyolf> damn -- I chose arch just to be exclusive -- I've come to the wrong room
15:49  Garoth> That's a stupid reason to Arch :0
15:49  eyolf> hehe
15:49  Garoth> :)*
15:50  jt_> I use Debian
15:50  eyolf> mkrist: what about you?
15:51  mkrist> I don't even use arch :) But I would if I were to choose distribution again
15:51  mkrist> I use Debian as well
15:51  tron> JUST DON'T USE FEDORA
15:51  jolts_> <3 arch
15:51  tron> Yeah, I'm an arch fan
15:51  jolts_> arch at home, ubuntu in school
15:52  tron> arch at home faildora at work
15:52  drone77> up debian
15:52  Garoth> up yours :)
15:52  tron> lol
15:52  tron> debian is very awesome too
15:53  tron> package system is good
15:53  drone77> oh i see
15:53  eyolf> good!?!
15:53  tron> eyolf: you don't like it?
15:53  eyolf> I used to have a debian system once... 
15:53  Garoth> As we say here in Canada, "We've upped our standards... so up yours"
15:53  eyolf> man, was it a relief to come to pacman
15:53  Garoth> :P
15:53  Garoth> Apt's fine
15:54  eyolf> not to mention ABS
15:54  Garoth> debs are fine
15:54  Garoth> Pacman is just better
15:54  tron> eyolf: well.. if you think deb is bad check out rpm and yum
15:54  tron> you will cry
15:54  Garoth> :)
15:55  jolts_> rpm is horrible ;o not touched it since i used mandrake/redhat for the first time a few years back
15:55  eyolf> it's not that deb is bad, it's ... I don't know -- dependency hell seems to be something one has to be used to in the debian world
15:55  jolts_> no dependancy support
15:55  eyolf> whereas to me, it's a foreign word
15:55  Garoth> nah, dependency hell doesn't happen in debian much
15:55  Garoth> That's a yum thing
15:56  tron> yeah... rpm/yum wins the bad package award, I have to deal with that shit
15:56  Garoth> And it's more how the tools are used rather than the tools themselves that create that scenaria
15:56  tron> I'M THE ONE WHO GETS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
15:56  eyolf> perhaps things have changed -- this was some years back
15:56  Garoth> scenario*
15:56  Garoth> Blaargh
15:56  Garoth> Stuff keeps crashing on my Ubuntu
15:57  tron> any of you use the 'sensors' program
15:57  Garoth> I think it senses its days are numbered
15:57  tron> How many fucking temperature chips are in a computer?!?!
15:57  Garoth> Quite.. a few
15:57  Garoth> :)
15:57  eyolf> at least two if they are fucking
15:57  Garoth> Hahaha :D
15:57  tron> yikes
15:57  eyolf> hot?
15:57  tron> I type sensors on the mac
15:57  tron> I have like 12
15:58  eyolf> so a gang-bang then
15:58  tron> I could make a temperature graph widget for this shit
15:58  Garoth> Take an average :)
15:58  tron> I most likely will
15:59  tron> or an average with a careful watch for any one critical temp!?
15:59  tron> Next time I'm in the airport I know somebody is going to fucking ask me about this computer
15:59  Garoth> D

16:00  Garoth> There was a Vista guy there, showing off
16:00  Garoth> So my friend shows him Linux
16:00  Garoth> nd explains how it's free... :P
16:01  Garoth> The dude flips out, starts shouting and cursing
16:01  Garoth> And breaks his computer by smashing it against the counter
16:01  tron> hah
16:01  drone77> hah
16:01  Garoth> And if you don't believe me, this was in Texas

17:08  farhaven> someone needs to do a lot of work with valgrind, i think
17:08  jinks> if if focus gvim it stops growing for 4 sec then resumes @ 8k
17:08  farhaven> and i hope that someone is not me
17:09  farhaven> mmh
17:09  farhaven> and it seems to grow every second...
17:09  farhaven> i think i have an idea
17:12  jinks> damn modern machines :)
17:13  jinks> it was actually growing since yesterday, but i just noticed when it passed 700mb and i ran out of physical memory
17:13  Garoth> Ouch.
17:15  stillunknown> awesome itself doesn't seem to leak, but a few libraries do.
17:15  stillunknown> (i did some valgrind'ing today)
17:15  *** jinks had hoped for awesome to be a little more lightweight than kde ;)
17:17  stillunknown> jinks: It should be.
17:17  Garoth> that hurts :)
17:17  farhaven> hmm
17:17  farhaven> with my minimal config, it still leaks memory
17:18  farhaven> though not as much as with my normal config
17:18  stillunknown> My awesome does slowly leak.
17:18  farhaven> and somehow it looks as if every focus change added 8k to awesome's used memory
17:18  stillunknown> I found the memory leak in cairo-xcb.
17:18  stillunknown> font rendering
17:18  farhaven> mmh
17:18  stillunknown> there's a leak in fontconfig
17:18  farhaven> so technically not our problem?
17:18  stillunknown> and the cairo leak was font related too
17:19  stillunknown> You may still be leaking in lua side.
17:19  stillunknown> farhaven: that attitude is a bad one
17:19  Garoth> It's always our problem :S
17:19  farhaven> stillunknown: i don't mean "we don't care for this"
17:19  farhaven> i meant to say we should notify the fontconfig people about that
17:20  stillunknown> there is no such thing as fontconfig people
17:20  farhaven> and somehow every triggering timer seems to add 8k also
17:20  farhaven> not?
17:20  farhaven> hmm
17:20  stillunknown> there's one person, who is not neccesarily jumping to do this.
17:22  stillunknown> Keith Packard made fontconfig and i wouldn't know of anyone else to poke.
17:23  stillunknown> farhaven: what kind of leakage do you get?
17:23  stillunknown> (it shouldn't be that bad)
17:23  farhaven> no, only 4/8k per second
17:24  j:t3rror2:(~root@adsl-074-236-251-094.sip.owb.bellsouth.net)
17:24  stillunknown> I've got a leak that is is maybe 25 kb/min
17:24  farhaven> though i think there must also be a leak in awesome itself
17:24  stillunknown> But maybe you do lot's of font rendering?
17:24  farhaven> as any change in focus generates an extra ~10k
17:25  stillunknown> anyway, just run valgrind, it's not that hard
17:25  farhaven> could you give me a pointer on how to start?
17:25  farhaven> though wait, i think i can figure it out myself
17:26  stillunknown> valgrind --leak-check=full awesome
17:26  stillunknown> If you use startx, you can easily place this in .xinitrc
17:26  stillunknown> (redirecting the output ofcource)
17:27  j:bastian:(~bastian@pD9FFFBEE.dip.t-dialin.net)
17:28  bastian> Hello
17:28  Garoth> Hey there, bastian
17:28  bastian> Just got a problem with awesome and rdesktop
17:28  q:micah:(~micah@micah.riseup.net)
17:28  jinks> have t go for now, good luck finding the leak
17:28  bastian> http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/x8omvwy9/20081108215319_1920x1200_scrot.png
17:29  bastian> Under the rdesktop session is a xterm window
17:30  bastian> I cant get rdesktop to use the "tiling "
17:30  farhaven> stillunknown: hmm, valgrind didn't really produce useful output
17:30  Garoth> I can't look at the image atm, but some programs refuse to tile due to not being able to resize.
17:30  farhaven> is there some kind of option for showing where exactly the lost memory was allocated?
17:30  bastian> Yes Garoth you're right rdesktop is not resizable
17:31  Garoth> bastian: I recommend just putting it on its own tag. That's the best I can think of, unfortunately.
17:31  bastian> ok
17:31  bastian> thx for the fast answers :)
17:31  bastian> And good night
17:31  q:bastian:(~bastian@pD9FFFBEE.dip.t-dialin.net)
17:31  Garoth> bastian: also, may be a good idea to set it to floating according to awesome.
17:31  stillunknown> farhaven: paste it, and let me judge :-)
17:32  farhaven> k, wait a sec...
17:33  farhaven> http://farhaven.pastebin.com/d4a1ed762
17:35  stillunknown> farhaven: You lack debug symbols on most things probably.
17:35  stillunknown> Still, cairo and fontconfig are the major leaks.
17:35  farhaven> mmh, then i'll rebuild cairo and fontconfig with debugging symbols
17:36  stillunknown> Well, all the leaks look like mine, only much worse ;-)
17:36  farhaven> hehe
17:36  j:pat_:(~kamikazze@p5790D952.dip.t-dialin.net)
17:36  farhaven> i noticed that while running awesome with valgrind, i was losing ~25k / second, where without valgrind, i only lost ~8k/second
17:37  farhaven> but that might be a coincidence
17:37  stillunknown> How long was this run?
17:37  farhaven> the first run was about 30 seconds
17:37  farhaven> the second about a minute, i think
17:37  farhaven> and gentoo won't let me build fontconfig with the debug useflag
17:37  farhaven> sucks
17:38  Garoth> farhaven: lol?
17:38  farhaven> yup
17:38  Garoth> Gentoo _won't let you build_ something
17:38  Garoth> Now that's just silly.
17:38  farhaven> well, it lets me build
17:39  Garoth> Gentoo: making you build your software, unless we say otherwise.
17:39  farhaven> but the fontconfig ebuild doesn't have a debug useflag
17:39  farhaven> hehe
17:39  stillunknown> add "nostrip" to FEATURES
17:39  stillunknown> as a good start
17:40  farhaven> makes sense
17:40  stillunknown> That'll get you a long way.
17:40  stillunknown> From a profiling pov, debugging, you'll get per function symbols, but no resolution inside the functions.
17:40  stillunknown> x86 or x86_64
17:40  stillunknown> ?
17:40  farhaven> x86
17:40  Garoth> MIPS
17:41  farhaven> lol
17:41  farhaven> anyway, i'm building cairo with debugging symbols
17:42  q:asmanian_:(~weechat@static-213-182-104-34.teleos-web.de)
17:42  q:adammichael:(~adam@cpe-67-240-2-210.nycap.res.rr.com)
17:42  stillunknown> cflags?
17:42  farhaven> nothing too fancy,wait
17:43  farhaven> CFLAGS="-march=core2 -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"
17:43  stillunknown> loose that last one
17:43  q:kopp_:(~kopp@AGrenoble-152-1-56-131.w83-201.abo.wanadoo.fr)
17:43  stillunknown> It hurts debugging.
17:43  Garoth> Lol, that last one makes me want to fomit
17:43  farhaven> lol
17:45  stillunknown> on x86_64 and some other arches you need to explictly carry -fno-omit-frame-pointer
17:45  stillunknown> (it hurts debugging there less, but it's still annoying)
17:45  farhaven> hmm, to be honest, i don't really know why it was in my cflags
17:45  farhaven> what does it do, anyway?
17:46  Gigamo> i have it in mine too :x
17:46  q:mkrist:(~mkrist@x1-6-00-16-b6-3b-47-99.k736.webspeed.dk)
17:47  stillunknown> farhaven: It omit's the frame pointer, which makes it impossible or harder to figure out where a function ends or starts.
17:48  farhaven> ah
17:49  stillunknown> Gigamo: over the years i've tuned my system for debug/trace/profileability.
17:49  farhaven> http://farhaven.pastebin.com/d147589e5
17:49  farhaven> a bit more verbose this time
17:49  stillunknown> same leaks for cairo and fontconfig
17:50  Garoth> Lua shouldn't leak, should it?
17:50  stillunknown> http://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo/commit/?id=164069b339843837e04e2522a615f03a83b362c0
17:51  stillunknown> Garoth: not in C sense
17:51  Garoth> stillunknown: is that a link that says that something has been fixed? :)
17:51  farhaven> yep
17:51  Garoth> Eeexcellent.
17:51  Garoth> stillunknown: okay, I understand.
17:51  Garoth> It just seems unlikely that lua would be written in a leaky way, it's harder to do.
17:51  stillunknown> But if you globally declare objects and do not delete them, you can keep stuff lingering.
17:52  farhaven> but you can still reach that stuff
17:52  Garoth> For sure, but it's harder to do.
17:52  Garoth> (without noticing)
17:52  farhaven> well, i had a piece of code which abused wiboxes so that technically, memory was lost
17:52  Gigamo> farhaven: -march=core2 is for core2duo cpu's?
17:52  farhaven> yep
17:52  Gigamo> ah nice
17:53  stillunknown> There's also march=native these days on GCC 4.3
17:53  stillunknown> iirc
17:53  farhaven> yeah, but i'm still on gcc 4.2
17:53  farhaven> or am i?
17:53  farhaven> mmh, nope, gcc 4.3
17:54  farhaven> and i noticed, that patch you linked to only fixes _cairo_xcb_emit_glyphs
17:54  farhaven> while loss is in _cairo_xcb_show_glyphs
17:55  stillunknown> emit glyphs is inlined to that function
17:55  farhaven> ah, k
17:55  Garoth> Man, stillunknown is mastered :)
17:55  farhaven> yup
17:55  farhaven> master of teh codez
17:55  farhaven> :D
17:55  Garoth> Yeah... leaks in cairo hurt
17:55  Garoth> Suddenly, everything leaks
17:56  stillunknown> cairo-xcb is an underdeveloped backend?
17:56  stillunknown> minus the ?
17:56  farhaven> mainly because xcb has not that much users
17:56  farhaven> i think
17:56  q:pat_:(~kamikazze@p5790D952.dip.t-dialin.net)
17:57  stillunknown> Anyway, it was an easy leak to fix.
17:57  stillunknown> for awesome it isn't that big of a problem
17:57  stillunknown> we are a minor user of cairo
17:57  stillunknown> and don't expect huge throughoutput
17:59  Garoth> Hmm. I'm having a good time in my Arch Live CD
17:59  Garoth> :)
17:59  Garoth> got bored waiting for backups and started playing music + chatting on IRC.
17:59  farhaven> lol
17:59  Garoth> Haven't used TTYs only for a while, good times.
18:13  farhaven> hmm, i'm going to bed
18:13  farhaven> good night :)
18:13  p:farhaven:(~gregor@Qe654.q.pppool.de)
18:15  Error323> lol Garoth 
18:17  Garoth> It's kind of quiet, but I don't want to set up ALSA at the moment
18:18  Error323> why r u reinstalling?
18:18  Garoth> Error323: I'm not, I'm trashing my Ubuntu and installing Arch.
18:19  Error323> ah, good job
18:19  Error323> =)
18:19  Garoth> (I use Arch everywhere else)
18:19  Garoth> Just taking a while due to having to back stuff up.
18:19  Error323> i c
18:19  Error323> ever heard of rsnapshot btw?
18:19  Error323> it's briljant
18:19  calmar> any advantages from arch cmp. to gentoo? :)
18:19  Error323> for backing up stuff
18:20  *** Error323 comes from ubuntu
18:20  Garoth> calmar: Less compiling. Much less.
18:20  Garoth> Error323: I'll look into it.
18:20  calmar> Garoth: all right. /me is going to look for that rsnapshot..
18:20  stillunknown> compiling does have it's advantages ;-)
18:21  calmar> well, it a packet-based (more) distro then I guess
18:21  Garoth> stillunknown: and compiling only the stuff you want to compile also does.
18:21  stillunknown> (but i have arch on my laptop, for obvious reasons)
18:21  Garoth> Arch has some other differences which I like.
18:22  Garoth> It has a slightly nicer package format, a system-wide configuration file, and a BSD-like init system that's very simple.
18:22  Garoth> There are also some nifty tools from the arch community, but you could probably use those anywhere.
18:22  calmar> Error323: cool tip, i'm actually using rsync but that is probably easier and better and based on rsync finally :)
18:22  Garoth> Tbh, Linux as pretty similar everywhere...
18:23  Error323> I like it's clean and the filosophy is good
18:23  Garoth> Lol, filosophy
18:23  Error323> ehh however that's spelled ^_^
18:23  calmar> i see, about arch. 
18:23  Error323> philosofy?
18:23  Garoth> Error323: Yeah, lots of good stuff there, but I was just comparing gentoo to arch
18:23  Error323> mmz
18:23  Garoth> Error323: lol!
18:23  Garoth> Philosophy :)
18:23  Error323> right =)
18:23  Garoth> I guess you knew.
18:23  Error323> ty
18:23  Error323> hehe
18:24  Garoth> I has gud filosofy
18:24  Garoth> 30% backed up...
18:24  Error323> calmar: yeah it's really convenient (that spelled ok?)
18:25  Garoth> Yep.
18:25  Error323> :)
18:25  Garoth> I see Arch as a nice minimal, do it yourself distro that also makes your life easy, and walks the middle path between source and binary.
18:25  Garoth> While keeping a very up to date and large package database.
18:26  drone77> eterm why won't you accept my font
18:26  Error323> lol
18:26  Error323> well im quite the virgin in linux anyway, my distro exploration is minimal
18:27  Error323> wanna try lfs once, just for learning purposes
18:27  Garoth> Error323: well, if you value your virginity, don't use SUSE. It'll rape you.
18:27  Error323> LOL
18:27  calmar> Error323: good idea :) takes some days so until it's installed completely
18:27  Garoth> Yeah, I don't think I'd ever want to actually _use_ LFS, but it's a good idea to try it.
18:27  jt_> anyone use gentoo on a laptop? I was thinking of trying it out, mainly for a 'learning experiance'
18:28  Garoth> It's certainly doable
18:28  calmar> i would like 'sourgemage' :) to check out
18:28  calmar> s/g/c/
18:28  Garoth> 53% back'd up :D
18:29  jt_> I backup everything to /dev/zero, is that a good place for it?
18:29  q:sevenfourk:(~sevenfour@79.124.175.251)
18:30  Garoth> I dare someone to "cat /dev/zero > /tmp/zero-file" for 1 minute -- exactly 60 seconds.
18:30  j:dimebar:(~dimebar@cpc2-oldh7-0-0-cust961.manc.cable.ntl.com)
18:31  Garoth> Though, I guess 30 minutes would be a lot funnier.
18:31  jt_> how much data does it put out :p
18:31  Error323> Garoth: what does it do?
18:31  Garoth> Error323: writes zeroes to a file.
18:31  Error323> lol
18:31  drone77> harmless zeroes
18:31  Garoth> Literal zeros, not character zeros
18:31  Garoth> drone77: harmless until you run out of space on your hd :)
18:32  dimebar> how do I hide the application icons on the title bar in awesome 3.0?
18:32  drone77> yep
18:32  Garoth> Which happens surprisingly fast with /dev/zero
18:33  Garoth> dimebar: I can't really test and figure it out for you atm, but there is a hook at the bottom of your rc.lua that is called when windows spawn
18:33  Garoth> So in there, you could probably either disable the images if they're being set there, or remove them afterwards
18:33  Garoth> woo, 80%
18:33  dimebar> Garoth: ah ok - i'll have a look; just needed pointing in the right direction :)
18:34  Garoth> Yeah, that's how I'd try to attack it. It's also possible that the tasklist has an option to turn them off? Idk.
18:36  Error323> well guys i'm off to bed
18:36  Error323> cya all
18:36  Garoth> Bye, Error323 
18:36  Error323> bye
18:37  drone77> night

18:42  Garoth> Well, I don't really know you that well.
18:42  aeroevan|laptop> i like breaking things
18:42  Garoth> heh :0

18:43  aeroevan|laptop> i used enlightenment for a few years, but awesome just gets out of my way
18:43  aeroevan|laptop> and that's waht i want in a wm
18:43  Garoth> Yep. Done anything cool with it?

18:55  adammichael> spend less time shuffling all my windows and more time doing stuff
18:57  Garoth> adammichael: yeah, in reality, people don't want windows to overlap.
18:57  Garoth> They just don't know it.
18:57  Garoth> But, awesome will let windows float and have titlebars too.
18:58  adammichael> yeah
18:58  Garoth> adammichael: enjoy, though. You'll find Awesome has a lot of nice, hidden features that are always plesant suprises.
18:58  adammichael> well i like the default 9 desktops ('tags')
18:58  Garoth> (not hidden per se, but not immediatley obvious)
18:58  aeroevan|laptop> some of my friends saw how tiling works and wanted to install it asap
18:58  Garoth> adammichael: no problem. I have 4 and they're named with words.
18:58  adammichael> so i've kind of set each one for certain stuff
18:58  aeroevan|laptop> it just makes things easy
18:58  adammichael> mod+# makes it easy
18:59  Garoth> adammichael: yeah, but awesome tags are better than desktops, actually
18:59  adammichael> plus
18:59  Garoth> You can view multiple ones at once and stuff
18:59  adammichael> i've got opera running and a few other stuff, and ive still have 740 of 1 gig free in mem
18:59  adammichael> 740MB i mean 
18:59  Garoth> Yep.
19:00  adammichael> load xfce4 and ive already used 400 MB
19:00  adammichael> im looking for an pdf viewer (maybe one that works like feh does)
19:02  Garoth> adammichael: I don't know a great one for what you want, but I use Evince
19:02  adammichael> Im looking into xpdf right now
19:02  adammichael> what about a file manager?
19:03  Garoth> I don't use a file manager.
19:03  Garoth> Thunar from XFCE is a popular choice.
19:03  Garoth> Midnight Commander is popular as a command line one
19:03  Garoth> I use just command line.
19:04  aeroevan|laptop> what shell?
19:04  stillunknown> i'd take a look at emelfm2
19:04  Garoth> I use zsh
19:04  stillunknown> (filemanager)

19:04  aeroevan|laptop> zsh is good
19:04  Garoth> I'll be back in a bit
19:05  adammichael> Yeah I'm not looking a heavy filemanager like thunar
19:05  adammichael> midnight commander might be a good one
19:05  adammichael> I'm very comfortable with the command line
19:05  adammichael> xpdf is nice
19:05  aeroevan|laptop> the more familiar you are with the command line, you'll start using a file manager less
19:06  aeroevan|laptop> adammichael: yeah, i use xpdf for quick pdf viewing
19:06  adammichael> yeah I don't edit pdf files much - I do read them on a regular basis.. emc and netapp insists on releasing their whitepapers in pdf format
19:07  Garoth> I'll be on and off during the install procedure, but hi

19:07  adammichael> and thanks Garoth for taking the time to chat
19:07  adammichael> you too aero
19:07  Garoth> Hey, good times :)
19:07  aeroevan|laptop> adammichael: i do alot of writing in LaTeX, so pdf viewing is a must
19:07  Garoth> aeroevan|laptop: +1
19:08  Garoth> But yeah, mc is very cool
19:08  adammichael> aero; what exactly is latex? i mean i know it's a markup - but I was never really familiar with its real-world application
19:08  Garoth> I don't find that I need it very often though.
19:08  aeroevan|laptop> adammichael: it is a markup language (like html) but for documents
19:08  Garoth> adammichael: it's a markup that lets you create PDFs that look as good as anything that any word processor could produce.
19:09  Garoth> And better, often
19:09  Garoth> Because it handles complex math rendering and so on
19:09  adammichael> Interesting.. would I use it to write docs and such? 
19:09  adammichael> documentation*
19:09  aeroevan|laptop> and it's plain text
19:09  aeroevan|laptop> i do
19:09  Garoth> Also, because it's a markup, it lets you do things like automatically reference bibliographies, link to sections on various pages by name, and so on
19:10  Garoth> I write all my school reports, documentation, and math in LaTeX when allowed.
19:10  adammichael> very nice, i'll definitely have to mark that into my increasing list of things I need to familiarize myself with
19:10  erikg> jd_: around?  we figured out why awesome isn't playing well with composition
19:10  Garoth> And if you're a vim user, there is a nice plugin called vim-latex-suite that makes working with latex easier.
19:10  Garoth> erikg: oh? :D
19:11  erikg> yeah.  it's explicitly mapping and unmapping windows
19:11  erikg> well... hmm.  the theory is that this is the problem
19:11  erikg> because looking at dwm, for instance, shows that it moves windows to offscreen when hiding them
19:11  erikg> whereas awesome unmaps
19:11  adammichael> evince wants too many deps
19:12  stillunknown> whoever wrote this should get a good kick:
19:12  stillunknown>  patterns->patterns[patterns->n_patterns++] = uniquify_pattern (fcfontmap, font_pattern);
19:12  Garoth> adammichael: well, if you care, then use xpdf 
19:12  Gigamo> hmmm, my awesome menu broke in one of the latest commits :<
19:12  Gigamo> W: awesome: luaA_dofunction:313: error running function: /usr/share/awesome/lib/awful/menu.lua:118: bad argument #3 to '?' (image expected, got userdata)
19:12  adammichael> Garoth: well isn't that the beauty of open source? :)
19:12  Garoth> Yep.
19:12  Gigamo> any idea?
19:13  Garoth> Gigamo: looks related to the latest beautiful changes, but that's a guess
19:15  calmar> Gigamo: look at the source awesomerc.lua to see the differences now.
19:15  calmar> e.g. you create and toggle it then afterwards etc
19:16  aeroevan|laptop> i keep a diff of my rc.lua against the default because something like that happened to me
19:16  Gigamo> hmmm i looked at default rc.lua and changed it but its still broken :s
19:18  Garoth> Need to write a git hook that makes a notification when the rc changes
19:20  j:canen:(~canen@72.252.109.32)

19:21  calmar> you want to paste the config?
19:22  stillunknown> Oh, lovely, i've been chasing a valgrind warning that is just confusion on valgrind's part.
19:22  Gigamo> calmar: ah, the keybind changed too
19:22  Gigamo> works now
19:22  Gigamo> or well, mousebind
19:25  calmar> ah good ;)
19:41  adammichael> does anyone know why this occurs: naim: hwprintf.c:42: h_zero: Assertion `strlen(h->addch.buf)
19:41  adammichael> when trying to run it
19:46  stillunknown> The cairo memory leak seems to be the only real (serious) one.
19:46  stillunknown> The rest is just false positives or so minor it's not really worth persueing

21:23  t3rror2> jt_: it looks good to me
21:23  ojirio> jt_: should work, maybe specify password if the network is secured with WEP key... if you want something better (which is what I'd do), use netcfg http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_Profiles
21:25  t3rror2> ojirio: i concur on the netcfg aoption

21:40  t3rror2> not sure
21:41  tron> what is the error?
21:42  t3rror2> ojirio: is there a specific place within the rc.lua that new keybindings are supposed to be defined?  maybe i have it in the wrong place.
21:42  jwbirdsong> http://pastebin.com/m3685d26c
21:43  jwbirdsong> tron: et al   ^^

21:45  tron> jwbirdsong: whoa.. that's an odd one
21:45  tron> not sure about that
21:46  jwbirdsong> anyone get errors building latest head in awesome-git??  asking in archlinux roon now also... see if anyone else gettint it

21:48  jwbirdsong> and no to answer the question
21:48  Seb> for instance, shouldn't "echo sldjfalksdjflasdkjf | awesome-client -" at least produce some error or something ?

22:21  t3rror2> ojirio: i just checked again and it was a typo keybindinng instead of keybinding, everything is working like it should now, thanks for the help
22:25  t3rror2> how outdated are the man pages for awesomerc?  i am assuming they are since the config isn't called awesomerc any more
22:26  bob2> t3rror2: no, the man page name hasn't changed
22:34  ojirio> np
22:38  t3rror2> in the man page for awesomerc, it makes mention of the lua API documentation being located in the directory luadoc, i can't find this directory on my arch install.  is there somewhere else that i can find this?
22:39  bob2> that'd be an issue with the arch equivalent of packages
22:39  bob2> should be in /usr/share/doc/awesome/luadoc/
22:40  t3rror2> well, yeah it is a problem with the arch packages then because there isn't a directory in /usr/share/doc/awesome
22:41  t3rror2> can anyone tell me what the browser is in the picture on the awesome home page?  i am looking for an alternative to opera
22:44  jwbirdsong> pretty sure you need to do a make luadoc to get it

23:10  rbistolfi> I dont think so adammichael

23:11  rbistolfi> surely with the viperator extension
23:12  rbistolfi> *vimperator
23:12  t3rror2> rbistofli: thx, i am not familiar with the vimperator extension, but i will look into it
23:13  t3rror2> is it feasable to think that i can create a new statusbar on the bottom of my screen and display most of the useful info that my conkyrc does now?
23:15  adammichael> alright
23:16  adammichael> then something else might be.. i don't get why the F1-F4 keys don't work (F5 & so on does)

23:44  rbistolfi> do you have something special in your ~/.Xmodmap ?
23:44  adammichael> i don't have an .Xmodmap configured
23:44  adammichael> i get 67 for F1 as well
23:45  adammichael> i find finch's UI fairly cumbersome
23:45  adammichael> their mistake was trying to emulate a windowed environment in a console window

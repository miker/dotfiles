19:53  _damjan> shouldnt echo 'return screen[1].client_focus.name' | awesome-client return something?
19:54  _damjan> it seems that client_focus is nil
19:54  j:muammar:(~muammar@190.38.144.71)
20:07  Garoth> I don't know, you'll have to research it more
20:07  zac_1> about my earlier issues:  I forgot to select a tag I think was the problem. And about cmake there was a config text file so that works great now, got the git version working
20:07  j:Olympic:(~Olympic@123.114.255.221)
20:07  Garoth> I don't know what you're talking about, but it's great that you figured it out.
20:08  zac_1> still working out some small things in the rc.lua, like no client is focused after closing one, and how to change colors in the tasklist for selected
20:09  Garoth> zac_1: huh?
20:09  Garoth> Both of those shouldn't be the case.
20:10  zac_1> well this is in a minimal rc.lua
20:10  zac_1> not the example one
20:10  Garoth> Oh, so you're writing it yourself?
20:10  zac_1> yeah
20:10  Garoth> good for you man, that's a great idea
20:10  zac_1> the wiki had a really good guide
20:12  j:nisc:(~nisc@sedanet0.sedan.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE)
20:13  Garoth> Hey there, nisc
20:15  q:_damjan:(~damjan@89.31.155.255)
20:16  tychoish> hey, so my awesome died tragically again
20:17  Garoth> Oh, cool.
20:17  tychoish> I'm the one with the awkward dual monitor problem 
20:18  *** Garoth shrugs
20:18  tychoish> cool cool
20:21  q:GGLucas:(~GGLucas@5357FFDA.cable.casema.nl)
20:21  zac_1> is the API doc on the site of the latest git? Is wibox in it?
20:21  Garoth> zac_1: no, it's for stable 3.0 release
20:21  Garoth> Which I think makes sense
20:21  Garoth> zac_1: you want to make doc or make docs or whatever it is to get the latest docs.
20:21  Garoth> But it's just generated from comments in the source
20:22  zac_1> I see
20:22  Garoth> So I often just read the source.
20:22  zac_1> do you know what file wibox documentation is in?
20:23  zac_1> oh wibox.c surely
20:23  Garoth> Yep :)
20:23  Garoth> Maybe wibox.h as well
20:23  Garoth> And possibly some stuff in lib/
20:31  gregf> anyone see a problme with this syntax, echo "awful.client.movetotag(tags[1][8], Firefox)" | awesome-client? Seems to be able to move the selected client but never the client name I specify.
20:32  Garoth> gregf: assuming the syntax is right and the second argument is a program name, it should be in quotes
20:32  Garoth> "Firefox"
20:32  Garoth> It's a string.
20:33  gregf> tried that too, not getting any errors back. If I quote it or not. It's odd that I can get it to move the selected client but not by name.
20:33  Garoth> Well, it's very likely that you don't have the right syntax.
20:33  zac_1> did you escape the quotes? \"
20:33  Garoth> zac_1: nice1
20:33  nisc> what great features have emerged since 3.0?
20:34  Garoth> nisc: lots of stuff...
20:34  gregf> zac_1: no did not try that
20:34  Garoth> I'm sure I can't think of everything, but for sure:
20:35  Garoth> awesome -k; awesome invaders; naughty(fications); more awful features
20:35  nisc> o_O
20:37  j:jt_:(~jake@68.42.230.212)
20:37  nisc> alright
20:37  q:nisc:(~nisc@sedanet0.sedan.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE)
20:37  Garoth> darn, he left
20:37  Garoth> I would have told him to read the git log for all stuff.
20:39  zac_1> for awesome.font_set, what is Pango font format? is it like X (-*-terminus-*-*etc)
20:40  gregf> i must be miss understanding what the api wants when they say client i guess. As none of the other items I am trying in the awful api work how I expect either.
20:40  zac_1> oh I think I see some examples in the source code
20:41  zac_1> "Verdana 8"
20:41  Garoth> gregf, zac_1: sorry, I can't really help here.
20:42  gregf> np, just kinda rambling I guess.
20:43  jt_> anyone here using arch?
20:43  zac_1> yeah
20:44  Garoth> jt_: lots are, I am
20:44  Garoth> Not atm, but at work I am :)
20:44  zac_1> site is back up
20:44  jt_> is there a social contract, like debians or anything?
20:44  Garoth> jt_: ?
20:45  jt_> http://www.debian.org/social_contract
20:45  jt_> does arch have anything like that?
20:46  q:viaken:(~viaken@66.96.251.117)
20:46  Garoth> jt_: yes, kind of
20:47  Garoth> jt_: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way
20:48  jt_> thanks Garoth
20:49  q:eyolf:(~weechat@0x50c733c2.boanqu1.static.dsl.tele.dk)
20:49  Garoth> jt_: see front page of wiki for some related stuff
20:54  jt_> I think I'm going to try out arch on day, it seems pretty cool
20:56  j:seynthantx:(~seynthant@c122-107-31-76.blktn5.nsw.optusnet.com.au)
20:57  Garoth> jt_: I really like it
20:58  Garoth> Pretty much, imo, there are two sorts of distros that are worth using
20:58  j:adlpaf-mobile:(~adlpaf-mo@190.37.215.132)
20:58  Garoth> graphical, easy ones that require little effort
20:58  Garoth> and command-line oriented, do-it-yourself ones that let you configure and learn Linux
20:58  Garoth> In my opinion, Arch is the most well-designed such do-it-yourself style distro
20:58  Garoth> And Ubuntu is the best graphical, easy one
21:00  jt_> for me, ubuntu has always been a pain in the ass. Debian has always worked better, and I can get a bare system when I install; which is what I like
21:01  j:Gigamo:(~Gigamo@d515256A1.access.telenet.be)
21:01  Garoth> jt_: well, debian tries to be all things for all people
21:01  Garoth> imo, if you want a bare system, Arch is the way to go
21:02  Garoth> And Ubuntu for new Linux users and people who don't want to configure their systems
21:02  tychoish> debian also has--relatively speaking--the manpower to support that 
21:02  Garoth> Yeah.
21:02  Garoth> And I think they do a pretty good job at being everything to everyone
21:03  Garoth> But I don't really need everything, I mostly only need one of the two extremes
21:03  jt_> I just need to make a backup of my awesome and irssi configs
21:03  Garoth> jt_: you should really just keep /home on a separate partition
21:03  jwbirdsong> < Garoth> jt_: I really like it (Arch)  +1 to that 
21:03  jt_> I have /home a seperate partition :D
21:04  Garoth> I really think Arch does stuff better than most minimal distros, such as Gentoo.
21:04  jwbirdsong> i came to arch from gentoo
21:04  q:ghostbar:(~ghostbar@190.37.3.35)
21:05  Garoth> jwbirdsong: what do you like better?
21:05  jt_> in fdisk I just need to specify that I want to use hda3 (/home) as /home right? (I've never used fdisk)
21:06  Garoth> I don't know
21:06  Garoth> I tend to use parted or whatever the installer has
21:06  jt_> I thought it used fdisk. I'll check the wiki
21:07  Garoth> jt_: well, Arch has a graphical interface to whatever it is.
21:08  Garoth> You know, in the command line
21:08  Garoth> I forget what it's like, but it was easy to use and very obvious
21:08  jwbirdsong> Garoth: as far as distro you mean?? arch far and away... I've used it since .0.7.2  gimmic... mid 2006 i think
21:08  jwbirdsong> tought to get me to change now
21:08  Garoth> jwbirdsong: what do you like better about arch compared with gentoo was the question
21:09  jwbirdsong> rolling release.... simplicity of config.... ABS/AUR
21:09  Garoth> Do you like that there are more binary packages?
21:09  Garoth> or do you mostly build stuff from source anyway?
21:09  jwbirdsong> good bit from source still
21:10  jwbirdsong> but not modo pkgs like OOO etc
21:10  jwbirdsong> s/mono/mondo
21:10  jt_> Garoth: I know about the gui installer, I don't like them, they've always been slow on my laptop. The install guide says it uses cfdisk
21:10  Garoth> I really like pacman and how easy it is to make packages
21:10  Garoth> jt_: well it's not really "gui" -- it's like ncurses or something
21:11  Garoth> It's a "console gui" thing
21:11  Garoth> so it shouldn't really be any slower than just literally using command line
21:11  jwbirdsong> in the installer for the partitoner you talking about?
21:11  Garoth> The partitioner in the installer, yeah
21:11  zac_1> about my earlier issues: I found in the API how to set focus color, and I misspelled the arrange hook, so it never got called and it needed to be called when a client closes
21:11  jt_> Garoth: I thought you ment gui like gtk gui, not ncurses :p
21:12  jwbirdsong> yeah I *think* it an NC dialog/readline kinda thing
21:12  zac_1> anyway I gotta go now. thanks for the help
21:12  Garoth> I know for sure it has that
21:12  jwbirdsong> but like I said I've not installed in almost 2 yrs now
21:12  jt_> one question: what's with the weird syntax for pacman?
21:12  q:zac_1:(~zac@145.116.2.147)
21:12  jwbirdsong> weird in what way?
21:12  Garoth> It is a bit odd, but after you figure it out, it's not so bad
21:12  Garoth> Well, it's unusual
21:12  Garoth> But basically, what they do is separate sets of tasks
21:13  jwbirdsong> -Suy all you need to remember
21:13  Garoth> So all -S ones are related to remote package management
21:13  Garoth> -Q ones are related to local ones
21:13  Garoth> and -R ones are related to removing packages
21:13  jt_> i'm not saying it's bad. I just find it odd that pacman -S is for installing something :p
21:13  Garoth> jt_: well, pretty much, you just pick the category of command you want to run, and then what specifically you want to do
21:13  jwbirdsong> thnk of the mnemonic for s as Sync
21:14  Garoth> "S" stands for sync, yeah
21:14  Garoth> It's not even a mnemonic, that's what it's meant to be
21:14  jwbirdsong> yeah 
21:14  Garoth> jt_: so it makes sense over time
21:14  Garoth> -Ss is "sync search" ie search the remote repo
21:14  j:viaken:(~viaken@66.96.251.117)
21:14  Garoth> -Su is "sync update" ie update from remote repo
21:15  jt_> ok, it doesn't seem so weird now
21:15  Garoth> -Ql is "query list" ie list files from local repo
21:15  Garoth> jt_: also install pacman-color and use that
21:15  Garoth> So pretty!
21:15  jwbirdsong> strange talking about this... earlier today I was watching everyone in the arch forum whinning about installer problems and decided to do a fresh install on a new partition just cuz it's been so long..
21:15  jwbirdsong> almost done D/L iso now
21:16  Garoth> jt_: and yaourt can be used to easily install AUR packages as well as doing all the pacman stuff
21:16  Garoth> A lot of people use yaourt, which is a wrapper for pacman really.
21:16  jwbirdsong> Garoth: never was a yourt fan.. just recently have started using arson tho
21:16  Garoth> jwbirdsong: well, what's not to like really?
21:16  Garoth> yaourt lets you do all the pacman stuff as well as AUR stuff
21:17  Garoth> I don't use it myself, but it sounds good to me.
21:17  jwbirdsong> never had any issue swith it.. just never really used it.. could have phrased that better i guess
21:17  Garoth> Yeah, I don't really see great need for it, but it has some nice features
21:17  Garoth> Such as being able to update your AUR packages automatically when new versions appear
21:17  jwbirdsong> exactly.. as does arson.. 
21:18  Garoth> I wouldn't know about arson
21:18  jwbirdsong> what I do reall enjoy lately is awesome.. only been using about a week.
21:18  Garoth> Anyway, at the moment, I just use pacman-color and do AUR stuff manually.
21:18  jwbirdsong> started on jd's birthday last week
21:18  jt_> can it manage locally built packages?
21:18  Garoth> jt_: yes
21:18  jwbirdsong> yeah
21:18  jt_> sweet
21:18  Garoth> jt_: so basically, this is how it works
21:18  Garoth> Arch supports both source and binary packages, really easily
21:18  jwbirdsong> off to smoke.. bbiab
21:19  Garoth> You can use pacman to easily download and install binary packages
21:19  Garoth> abs (arch build system) lets you rebuild the binary stuff that pacman uses
21:19  Garoth> And then there is AUR, which is the arch user repository which lets you build community packages
21:19  Garoth> jt_: one of the features of Arch is probably the easiest package format you'll ever see
21:20  Garoth> In the most basic format, you just have 1 file -- a PKGBUILD -- that says everything about the package that you need to know
21:20  Garoth> It usually is like 25 lines and is extremely easy
21:20  jt_> sounds great, I think I'll give it a go this weekend if I have time
21:21  Garoth> So the way AUR works is that they have these PKGBUILDs and occasionally some extra files
21:21  jt_> thanks for all the info Garoth, gonna go now
21:21  jt_> later
21:21  Garoth> You download the PKGBUILD into a directory, run makepkg, and it downloads the source, extracts it, builds the package for you
21:21  Garoth> And then you install it with pacman,
21:21  Garoth> bye

16:03  farhaven> yep
16:03  Cosmonaut> wlan? never stable
16:03  Garoth> But everyone all over the world knows Obama
16:04  Garoth> He's like the rockstar president
16:04  Cosmonaut> yes, all the foreigners have been congratulating us on not having bush as pres
16:04  Cosmonaut> next time I go to Europe, things will be much nicer

16:08  *** Garoth practises his Quebec French laugh
16:09  farhaven> O_o
16:09  Garoth> Canada's awesome.
16:09  Cosmonaut> where is Canada?
16:09  Garoth> All the TV shows Canada makes are Comedy
16:10  Garoth> Cosmonaut: Canada is the giant country that's bigger than the States, right above the states' northen border
16:10  Cosmonaut> oh, our attic?
16:10  Garoth> (fucking yankees make maps that make themselves look bigger)
16:10  Cosmonaut> there are people up there?
16:10  Garoth> :P
16:10  Cosmonaut> HAHAHA
16:10  Cosmonaut> I kid
16:10  Cosmonaut> Canada is rad
16:11  koniu> everyone's getting so excited about obama tho, like it meant that much. makes me kinda sick
16:11  Garoth> Heh, leaders in the states have real power though
16:11  Garoth> Not like in Canada ;)
16:11  Garoth> In Canada, things are good and it's impossible to change.
16:12  koniu> 'real power' refered to a politician sounds pretty scary to me :P
16:12  Garoth> Seriously, Candaa fails at politics
16:13  Garoth> We have 2.5 parties, all of which sound identical
16:13  Garoth> They get elected in based on pretty much random chance
16:13  Garoth> And we can have a "minority government" here, where the government doesn't have absolute control
16:13  Garoth> (ie. the other parties can gang up on them and vote the other way)
16:13  Garoth> The Prime Minister literally is just a guy. He doesn't really have special power.
16:14  koniu> in poland its very similar, there are 2 general sides and they get elected on a round-robin basis
16:14  Cosmonaut> oh no
16:14  q:sm217:(~sm@92.112.50.228)
16:14  Cosmonaut> ***undefined reference to `cairo_xcb_surface_create'***
16:14  Cosmonaut> in awesome make... that can't be good
16:14  Garoth> So yeah, in Canada, we have minorities so no one really has power. As a result, nothing ever really changes. However, since things are actually pretty good in Canada (we're frequently near the top of the best places to live worldwide), no on really cares.
16:15  Garoth> In fact, voter turnout is at an all time low.
16:15  Garoth> And Canada is great as a result :)
16:15  Garoth> Go figure.
16:15  Cosmonaut> lol
16:15  Cosmonaut> it's hockey
16:15  Cosmonaut> they're all too busy watching hockey
16:15  Garoth> Make a democracy that doesn't offer change, set the default to good, ... ... profit
16:15  Garoth> Yes.
16:15  Garoth> You're right.
16:16  Garoth> Just about every Canadian loves their hockey.
16:16  Cosmonaut> OILERS FOR PRIME MINISTER?!
16:16  Garoth> Hockey is about as violent as it gets in Canada
16:16  Garoth> Guns, what are guns?
16:16  Garoth> Eh?
16:16  Garoth> EH?!
16:16  Cosmonaut> ok, here is an odd one
16:16  Cosmonaut> ./configure cairo is happy as a user but not as root
16:16  Cosmonaut> ??
16:16  gregf> bah oilers
16:17  Garoth> bah Cenaturds
16:17  Garoth> RIOT!
16:17  Garoth> ... well, just a small one.
16:17  Garoth> With pillows to hit things with.
16:17  gregf> heh
16:17  Garoth> ;)
16:18  Garoth> gregf: you a Canadian buddy here?
16:18  gregf> nah, states. hockey fan though.
16:18  Garoth> Oh, okay.
16:18  Cosmonaut> lol
16:18  gregf> i can spit on canada from here though
16:18  Cosmonaut> go Avs
16:18  Garoth> Man, terrorists don't want to attack Canada. Too many of their family members happily live here :)
16:18  Cosmonaut> hahahaha
16:19  gregf> lol
16:19  Garoth> I have some Sikh friends. The Sikh people don't really have a history of terrorism, but they are the guys with the turbans and long beards.
16:19  Cosmonaut> hah
16:19  Garoth> Anyway, so my friend was saying that the Sikh People love Canada. It's like a second home to them.
16:20  Garoth> There is a massive community of them here.
16:20  Cosmonaut> that's funny
16:20  Cosmonaut> maybe they'll get into hockey
16:20  Garoth> Oh, for sure :)
16:20  Garoth> That'd be great.
16:20  Cosmonaut> can you imagine playing hockey with a long beard?
16:20  Cosmonaut> ouch..
16:20  Garoth> You'd tuck it in, I'm sure :)
16:20  eyolf> they wouldn't need any helmets, though
16:20  Garoth> Hahaha
16:20  Garoth> But yeah, they're not allowed to cut their hair.
16:21  Garoth> Real manly-like
16:21  Cosmonaut> what version of cairo are you guys using?
16:21  Cosmonaut> does the latest git dislike 1.6.4?
16:22  Garoth> Cosmonaut: lol, 1.8.0-1
16:22  gregf> i'm using 1.6.4 but not running git 
16:22  koniu> 1.6.4-6.1 here
16:22  Garoth> Oh you guys :)
16:22  Garoth> Get with the program.
16:22  Garoth> ;)
16:22  Garoth> 1.8.0-1 ftw
16:22  koniu> what are the advantages?
16:23  Garoth> koniu: oh, lots. Higher version number for one. Bragging rights for another.
16:23  Garoth> It also makes me feel manlier.
16:23  Cosmonaut> lol
16:23  koniu> thats what i thought
16:23  Garoth> ;)
16:23  Cosmonaut> ok... problem: I have the latest git
16:23  Garoth> I'm sure there were some changes.
16:23  Cosmonaut> I have cairo 1.6.4
16:23  q:tsdh:(~horn@p54AF235C.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
16:23  gregf> yeah well when 1.6.6.6 comes out were going to have super powers so
16:23  Cosmonaut> 1.8.0 requires a higher version of pixman than fedora provides
16:23  Garoth> gregf: o_0
16:23  Cosmonaut> and I don't want to build EVERYTHING FOR ETERNITY
16:24  gregf> to much?
16:24  Garoth> Cosmonaut: Hahaha
16:24  gregf> :P
16:24  Cosmonaut> do we know if latest git works with 1.6.4?
16:24  Garoth> Yeha, that's a real problem
16:24  Cosmonaut> how do gentoo people do it?
16:24  Garoth> koniu: you had that, right?
16:24  Garoth> Cosmonaut: no fucking clue
16:24  gregf> Cosmonaut: i have a live ebuild i wrote
16:24  Garoth> http://qdb.mercenariesguild.net/73
16:24  gregf> just not using it right now
16:24  Cosmonaut> I mean.. I love watching characters scroll by on my screen because it looks like THE MATRIX
16:24  Cosmonaut> but damnit
16:24  Cosmonaut> (kidding)
16:25  j:calmar:(~calmar@80-218-22-169.dclient.hispeed.ch)
16:25  Cosmonaut> so. who has the latest git that's on here right now
16:25  gregf> Cosmonaut: i'm not using the latest git, but if you are using gentoo I have a live ebuild in my overlay that works. I just down graded because my box doesn't like xorg 7.4 right now
16:25  Garoth> Cosmonaut: hi!
16:26  Cosmonaut> I don't have gentoo
16:26  gregf> Cosmonaut: sorry miss understood you
16:26  Cosmonaut> I have Fedora... this is the problem..
16:26  Garoth> My git version is 1.6.0.3
16:26  Cosmonaut> haha
16:26  Garoth> That's very recent :P
16:26  Cosmonaut> anyone else?
16:27  Garoth> Cosmonaut: what's the question?
16:27  Cosmonaut> does cairo 1.6.4 work with latest git
16:27  gregf> Cosmonaut: well normally xorg pulls in cairo. I know you'll need a minimal of xorg 7.3 for the latest xcb-utils. fedora should pull in what it needs for cairo with the rest
16:28  Cosmonaut> gregf: I'm building cairo because fedora is old
16:28  gregf> gentoo uses cairo 1.8.x when upgrading xorg
16:28  gregf> so i would go with that
16:28  Cosmonaut> ok, yeah the trouble with 1.8.0 is that I need pixman > fedora has
16:29  Cosmonaut> I might be able to find an rpm in koji
16:31  Cosmonaut> hmm an fc10 rpm has pixman 0.12
16:32  Garoth> Cosmonaut: is your computer so high powered that you could run Arch in a VM and not notice lag? :)
16:32  Cosmonaut> it's my work laptop....
16:32  Cosmonaut> thinkpad T61
16:33  j:bavardage:(~bavardage@87.114.16.156.plusnet.thn-ag3.dyn.plus.net)
16:34  koniu> 1.6.4 works with current git here debian lenny+sid/experimental
16:34  Garoth> Cosmonaut: ^^
16:34  Cosmonaut> GAHHHHHHHHHHHH
16:34  gregf> koniu: way to ruin the fun
16:36  koniu> sorry i would've spoilt it much earlier but there were ppl shouting followed by about 10 cop cars zooming in all directions past my house so i went to check it out
16:36  koniu> its like war out there tonite
16:36  Cosmonaut> put it in a fishtank
16:36  Cosmonaut> damn
16:36  bavardage> what's happening tonight?
16:37  gregf> crazy
16:37  Cosmonaut> crap... I don't know why it is doing that
16:37  gregf> where do you live?
16:37  koniu> 5 november, day when someone tried to blow the british parliment up 
16:37  gregf> ah
16:37  bavardage> koniu: you in UK then?
16:37  koniu> yeah
16:37  bavardage> is very serene here ;P
16:37  bavardage> can vaguely hear fireworks
16:37  bavardage> if I turn the tv off
16:37  bavardage> then again, where are you in UK
16:37  koniu> hackney, london =D
16:37  bavardage> (I'm in a smallish village, so you wouldn't expect anything much)
16:37  bavardage> oh haha
16:37  bavardage> yeah
16:38  koniu> the firework shootings have been going for about a month now :P
16:38  bavardage> isn't it banned in london though, from 9pm onwards?
16:38  bavardage> or is it 11pm
16:38  koniu> lol didnt know that
16:38  koniu> maybe
16:38  koniu> it did get quieter and the cop thing happened right after nine
16:39  Garoth> Remember remember...
16:39  Garoth> ;)
16:39  koniu> :D
16:39  bavardage> exactly
16:39  bavardage> do other countries have a bonfire night equivalent+?
16:39  bavardage> apart from the commonwealth 5th november stuff
16:39  koniu> i live right by a park called london fields where there's a massive bonfire (didnt go) and the area gets proper dodgy
16:39  Cosmonaut> 4th of July? fireworks and bonfires
16:40  koniu> hehe in ireland they have orangist day with MASSIVE bonfires
16:40  koniu> **northern ireland
16:40  Garoth> Man, organist? Pianist? Who named these professions and why are they so similar?!
16:41  bavardage> wtf?
16:41  bavardage> one plays the organ?
16:41  bavardage> one plays the piano?
16:41  bavardage> PERHAPS
16:41  Garoth> Oh yeah, you can play with my organ any time you want :)
16:41  j:stillunknown:(~stillunkn@82-136-225-75.ip.telfort.nl)
16:41  Garoth> I hear you're a pro pianist too ;)
16:41  bavardage> oh nice
16:41  bavardage> yeah I am
16:41  Garoth> Wait
16:41  Garoth> Aren't you asleep, or ran away or something?
16:41  bavardage> I said I'm going
16:42  bavardage> and I came back
16:42  bavardage> I went to watch tv
16:42  Garoth> Okay :)
16:42  bavardage> but then decided to laptop+tv
16:42  Cosmonaut> Garoth: is pro on the skin flute!!
16:42  bavardage> since tv didn't hold my attention
16:43  Garoth> Cosmonaut: nice, haven't heard that one before :)
16:43  Cosmonaut> hah
16:44  Cosmonaut> freaking cairo....
16:46  Cosmonaut> well... now I'm stuck
16:46  stillunknown> bad experience with cairo?
16:47  Cosmonaut> stillunknown: I can build and install
16:47  Cosmonaut> but then I get an error when I try to make awesome
16:47  bavardage> this is fedora?
16:47  Cosmonaut> yes fedora
16:47  Cosmonaut> this worked on my other fedora box though....
16:47  Cosmonaut> so I know it works
16:48  Cosmonaut> the only difference between the two is the git version, so that was my first guess
16:48  Cosmonaut> and now the only funny thing I notice is that ./configure works for my user, but not for root
16:48  stillunknown> You're installing a git version of cairo?
16:49  Cosmonaut> git awesome
16:49  Cosmonaut> cairo 1.6.4
16:49  Cosmonaut> building cairo from source though
16:49  Cosmonaut> because Fedora is way behind and I need xcb enabled
16:49  bavardage> I'm using cairo 1.8.4
16:50  Cosmonaut> the error in awesome make is in function draw_rotate
16:50  bavardage> yeah
16:50  bavardage> arch's cairo is version 1.8.x
16:50  Cosmonaut> that should be in cmake no?
16:50  q:farhaven:(~gregor@f054231151.adsl.alicedsl.de)
16:51  stillunknown> What has cmake got to do with it?
16:51  Cosmonaut> well, awesomes config
16:51  Cosmonaut> usually versions are included
16:51  Cosmonaut> so that it would break early claiming I had the wrong version of cairo
16:51  bavardage> hmm
16:51  bavardage> well just saying...
16:51  stillunknown> It should.
16:51  Cosmonaut> it did not
16:52  Cosmonaut> building and installing cairo 1.6.4 with xcb got me past that error
16:52  Cosmonaut> so if it's 1.8.x and 1.6.4 no longer works... version should be included
16:52  bavardage> hmm
16:55  q:bash:(~bash@89-97-140-221.ip17.fastwebnet.it)
16:55  Cosmonaut> well I think I will attempt getting cairo 1.8.0 on here tonight
16:56  stillunknown> I never tried to install awesome on cairo older than 1.8.0
16:56  q:magnet:(~magnet@AMontpellier-259-1-22-54.w92-133.abo.wanadoo.fr)
16:56  j:magnet:(~magnet@AMontpellier-259-1-22-54.w92-133.abo.wanadoo.fr)
16:57  Cosmonaut> I have it with 1.6.4 on this box
16:57  stillunknown> What is the failure exactly?
16:57  bavardage> you
16:57  Cosmonaut> undefined reference to `cairo_xcb_surface_create
16:57  bavardage> or that
16:58  Cosmonaut> in function `draw_rotate'
16:58  Cosmonaut> awesome draw.c:881
16:58  stillunknown> Sounds like an old lib lingering.
16:58  Cosmonaut> remove the other cairo stuff?
16:59  stillunknown> I'd be careful with doing anything hasty, just check for the usual /usr/lib vs local stuff.
16:59  Cosmonaut> I put the new cairo in /usr/lib
17:00  stillunknown> I must admit being spoiled by gentoo, so i'm not that experienced with the problems of megafreeze distros.
17:01  Cosmonaut> haha yeha, I hate this thing
17:01  bavardage> same with arch...
17:01  bavardage> this sounds very messy :D
17:01  stillunknown> To some point it's a major flaw, not being able to deploy per-app libraries.
17:02  Cosmonaut> it is messy when you want things like awesome
17:02  Cosmonaut> anyway, I'll get it eventually
17:04  stillunknown> Some might say you wouldn't have this issue on windows (and i don't like windows, honestly).
17:04  bavardage> on windows everything ships their own libraries pretty much
17:05  bavardage> well, you don't get shared libs to the same extent
17:05  stillunknown> But you can't do this on any linux based system.
17:05  bavardage> can't do what?
17:05  stillunknown> Which is problematic for 3rd party applications.
17:05  bavardage> can't do what?
17:05  stillunknown> Deploy per-app libraries in a sane way.
17:05  bavardage> surely there's static compilation
17:06  bavardage> so you can
17:06  stillunknown> I was talking about still having dynamic libraries.
17:06  bavardage> but if you're deploying libraries per-app
17:06  bavardage> then why make them dynamic
17:07  stillunknown> awesome for example relies on a great deal of libraries, for some it would be great if you could drop in one or two new ones without messing up the rest of the system.
17:08  bavardage> hmm
17:08  Cosmonaut> hehe
17:08  Cosmonaut> fun problems
17:08  bavardage> well updating to latest cairo etc hasn't screwed me over at all
17:08  stillunknown> Because your distro does it for you.
17:08  stillunknown> Which isn't 3rd party.
17:08  bavardage> :D
17:08  bavardage> yeah but for 3rd party
17:08  bavardage> there's AUR
17:08  bavardage> what does the distro actually do?
17:08  stillunknown> 3rd party != package manager
17:09  bavardage> well don't install 3rd party?
17:09  bavardage> you don't need to, when you got makepkg :P
17:10  stillunknown> A package manager is an (unfornate and nice) neccesity.
17:10  bavardage> you should try gobolinux
17:10  stillunknown> A base system + 3rd party applications (outside the control of the distro) is almost impossible.
17:10  bavardage> "GoboLinux is an alternative Linux distribution which redefines the entire filesystem hierarchy.
17:10  bavardage> In GoboLinux you don't need a package manager because the filesystem is the package manager:"
17:11  bavardage> anyway
17:11  stillunknown> It's not for me, i was merely pointing out a problem that most of us take as normal.
17:11  bavardage> I like having everything under the control of the package manager
17:11  bavardage> I think of it as a feature
17:11  bavardage> :D
17:11  bavardage> wish windows had a package manager tbh
17:11  bavardage> though I don't use windows day-to-day, so it doesn't affect me
17:12  bavardage> but on the rare occasions I boot windows, everything is out of date
17:12  bavardage> and you have to update it all manually
17:12  stillunknown> The problem with distro packages is that most of them are outdated, minus the bleeding edge distributions.
17:13  bavardage> so bleeding edge is the way to go :D
17:13  stillunknown> (arch and gentoo testing for example)
17:13  Cygal> that's the point stillunknown.
17:13  bavardage> I can see for servers you want stability
17:13  bavardage> but tbh, I have had no stability issues with arch
17:14  j:Garoth2:(~garoth@69.162.111.13)
17:14  Garoth> stillunknown: it's a 3rd party package repo that can be handled by the package manager

17:14  Garoth2> Meh.
17:14  ~:Garoth2 >> Garoth
17:15  Cosmonaut> yah Fedora is way slow
17:15  Garoth> Yep.
17:15  Cosmonaut> we rely on Centos.. we just got python 2.4 not that long ago
17:15  stillunknown> It still puts the control into the distribution.
17:15  Cosmonaut> which is absurd
17:15  bavardage> hah
17:15  Cosmonaut> hehe, I'm an odd one out, trying to use a bleeding edge wm on Fedora
17:15  *** bavardage strokes his python 2.6
17:16  Cosmonaut> strokes his python sounds dirty
17:16  Garoth> stillunknown: well... not *really*... these packages are made by random people without any checking. They could easily still break stuff. All it does is add it to the package db.
17:16  stillunknown> But it's still no answer if i wanted to tell you, "Here is a single package that works everywhere".
17:16  q:calmar:(~calmar@80-218-22-169.dclient.hispeed.ch)
17:17  stillunknown> Unless you static link everything.
17:17  Garoth> So it's 3rd party in the sense that it's not necessarily handled by any maintainers that have a title in the arch community
17:17  bavardage> and if you just want to ship libraries anyway
17:17  bavardage> why is static linking a problem
17:17  Garoth> stillunknown: I don't know what you're talking about there, I joined in late :)
17:17  stillunknown> The discussion got started when Cosmonaut had some issues installing awesome on one of his systems.
17:18  stillunknown> And i mentioned that there is no nice way to deploy an application + some newer libraries on a linux-like system.
17:19  bavardage> STATIC LINKING!!!ELEVEN!!
17:19  stillunknown> I explicitly said libraries, as you might have to compile them too ;-)
17:19  Cosmonaut> Garoth: I started it
17:20  Cosmonaut> with Faildora
17:20  stillunknown> Although i do not know how easy it is do a bunch of new libraries and staticly link to those.
17:20  Garoth> stillunknown: yeah, mostly I just wanted to say that I thought AUR was 3rd party.

21:10  koniu> what i do is just each time client pops up, scan the config table for matching props and create a tag/move client accordingly/switch to the tag
21:10  koniu> this is done using a hook called 'manage'
21:11  koniu> awful.hooks.manage.register(apptag)
21:11  koniu> apptag being the function doing all the matching and mangling
21:12  koniu> if you're brave enough, i think it should be quite easy to drop-in shifty to most configs
21:13  koniu> you can see how it works and have some input
21:14  gregf> well that might be enough info to get me going
21:14  gregf> i'll have to give it a shot, only been using awesome/lua for about a week.
21:14  gregf> nice language though from what I have seen so far
21:14  gregf> brb sorry

21:16  gregf> so can shifty drop into 3.0? if so I wouldn't mind playing with it a little. 
21:16  koniu> hmmmm 3.0, i doubt it
21:17  koniu> maybe
21:17  koniu> maybe not, the taglist stuff changed
21:17  gregf> no biggy, i really think you just gave me enough info to get going.
21:17  koniu> sure
21:17  gregf> appreciate the help
21:18  koniu> no probs. if u get stuck, have a peek at apptag function here http://silenceisdefeat.org/~koniu/awesome/shifty.lua
21:21  gregf> hooks.manage.regsiter isn't even in the api, good thing I got some hints from you I guess. I was reading the awful.lua code rather than tabulous.
21:23  koniu> in your rc.lua you should have that bit somewhere at the end
21:24  koniu> it points to a function called hook_manage
21:24  koniu> you can add the matching there, it's called each time a new client is registered
21:25  gregf> yep, see it... just was trying to say that would have never known without talking to you. When I first started trying to do this I read the api first. looked in the code for hook_manage and started to play with what I had learned from the api. Glad I bothered you :)
21:27  koniu> it's cool, i started around 3.0pre6 release which is not so long ago, so i know your pain. you'll catch up fast enough, it's all pretty easy

09:46  koniu> (at least no point in looking at c code =)
09:46  farhaven> jd_: hmm, true
09:46  jd_> every lib will start put random data which will be public
09:46  koniu> lol
09:46  jd_> keeping data and attribute private in each lib is nice
09:47  jd_> it's up to each lib to use the system she wants to do that, using a table is a good way I think
09:47  jd_> just do extended_attribute_get(mytag, 'name') and that's it :)
09:47  farhaven> hehe
09:47  jd_> should be 10 lines of Lua to implement a standard such thing in your lib
09:48  jd_> it does not worth exposing public data that could be mess around and add 100 L of C code to handle such a thing, IMHO
09:48  jd_> i.e. we do use that mechanism in awful titlebar for example
09:48  jd_> it works quite well :)

10:06  Garoth> That's like... 6 commits today
10:06  Garoth> And it's only 10 am my time :S
10:07  jd_> it's 16 here
10:07  Garoth> Yeah, I figured.
10:07  jd_> so 6 is kinda lame
10:07  Cosmonaut> Garoth: I wanted to play invaders
10:07  Garoth> Lol, kind of lame
10:07  Garoth> Cosmonaut: ... so?
10:07  Cosmonaut> so I found a bug
10:07  Garoth> Yes.
10:07  Cosmonaut> and we needed a commit
10:07  Garoth> Right.
10:07  Cosmonaut> go back to sleep
10:07  jd_> but I've been stuck in a sort of meeting whole of the day to prepare commercial proposition for a maybe-futur-customer
10:07  Garoth> Why?
10:08  Garoth> jd_: just sell them awesome
10:08  farhaven> hehe
10:08  Garoth> don't tell them it's free.
10:08  farhaven> jd_: how did it go?
10:08  Cosmonaut> We know you were looking for a web service... but instead we have a killer window manager... how about it?
10:08  Garoth> jd_: what do you even do?
10:09  farhaven> that is quite an interesting question
10:09  Garoth> I mean, aside from hack on awesome all day...
10:09  j:senses3:(~senses3@cpe-98-27-169-85.neo.res.rr.com)
10:09  Garoth> I think jd is a sys admin. That's my guess :)
10:10  farhaven> i think jd is plainly awesome all day
10:11  Cosmonaut> Opera Singer
10:11  senses3> anyone have any idea why awesome would just show a blank screen after logging in?
10:11  koniu> Cosmonaut: yeah, ive seen that on his cv the other day
10:11  farhaven> senses3: maybe your config is broken
10:11  Garoth> Lol, source code: bool bNeedFuzzy = false;
10:11  senses3> awesome -k says it's fine
10:12  farhaven> try starting awesome from a terminal, that should spit out some error messages
10:12  Garoth> Needs more fuzzy!
10:12  senses3> alright
10:12  farhaven> yeah, awesome -k only checks for syntax
10:12  senses3> ah
10:12  Cosmonaut> any errors on ctrl-alt-f1?
10:12  farhaven> and, i noticed, even if the config is broken, awesome -k still says "configuration file is OK"
10:12  farhaven> after reporting errors
10:12  Garoth> farhaven: because it's syntax only, not run-time checking
10:12  senses3> but the thing is 
10:12  Gigamo> maybe "configuration file is OK" should be changed to "No errors found in config file"
10:12  senses3> it's the default rc.lua
10:12  Gigamo> :D
10:13  Garoth> senses3: also, .xsession-errors
10:13  farhaven> Garoth: yeah well, it reports errors and then says the file is okay
10:13  Garoth> Yeah, that's fubar
10:13  farhaven> heh
10:13  senses3> i have to start another x session
10:13  senses3> brb
10:13  Garoth> ... do you?
10:13  farhaven> i think it'd be better if it just said "config file checked"
10:13  Garoth> o_0
10:13  Garoth> Hahaha
10:13  senses3> well if i wanna try it i have to stop gnome
10:13  Garoth> config file checked. Doesn't tell if it found anything wrong or not, but it gets points for trying.
10:13  senses3> and i dont really want to
10:13  j:t3rror2:(~root@rrcs-74-87-135-212.west.biz.rr.com)
10:14  Garoth> Oh.
10:14  Gigamo> cant you just open up a terminal and do like killall metacity && awesome
10:14  senses3> hmmm
10:14  Garoth> I like Gigamo's way :)
10:14  senses3> never thought of that
10:14  damjan> Gigamo: no
10:14  Garoth> And then it'll break...
10:14  Gigamo> :P
10:14  farhaven> Garoth: still better than saying "everything is ok" after reporting errors :D
10:14  CIA-6> awesome: Julien Danjou  * r67c56d35a42e /layouts/max.c: max: use phys_screen to get focus client (FS#366)
10:15  damjan> if the awesome process it the master session process, once you kill it your session ends
10:15  Garoth> damjan: uhm... but it's not :)
10:15  jd_> I'm a sysadmin
10:15  Gigamo> yeah but hes running gnome
10:15  Garoth> gnome-session is
10:15  damjan> some other WM's have suport for exec'ing other WM's
10:15  Garoth> hey, you all heard it!
10:15  Garoth> My guess was right, jd_'s a sys admin
10:15  jd_> but since I work very well and quickly, and that consequently mostly everything works fine, I'm under-employed :)
10:15  farhaven> lol
10:15  Garoth> That's actually why my guess was "sys admin"
10:15  farhaven> i'd like to be under-employed
10:16  farhaven> but actually, i'd be happy to be employed at all
10:16  Garoth> They have a sweet job that involves sitting around a lot with spare time, waiting for disaster
10:16  j:w00t:(~w00t@adsl-77-86-106-48.karoo.KCOM.COM)
10:16  Garoth> ANd hacking on awesome
10:16  jd_> yeah
10:16  q:senses3:(~senses3@cpe-98-27-169-85.neo.res.rr.com)
10:16  Garoth> Sys Admin is my dream job if I have to have a job.
10:16  farhaven> hehe, mine too
10:16  Garoth> I'm a programmer by training, but sys adminning sounds like way more fun (on *nix)
10:16  jd_> what, you're so rich that you don't work ?
10:17  Garoth> jd_: nah, I just like the sound of self-employment / starting a company
10:17  Garoth> I'm at work right now :)
10:17  farhaven> lol
10:17  j:bavardage:(~bavardage@87.115.70.53)
10:17  *** magnet hear a pleasing sound
10:17  jd_> well actually, I do prefer sys admin because the current markets, around in my company, is to develop Web apps, and that just suck so sysadmin is way more cool, and at least if I code, I do low-level Unix-related stuff
10:17  bavardage> how do I use beautiful in modules?
10:17  bavardage> I just keep getting 'nil' values
10:18  jd_> did you load a theme ?
10:18  Garoth> jd_: I actually really enjoy monkeying around on the command line and writing scripts all day :)
10:18  bavardage> no..
10:18  bavardage> I have to load a theme in a module too?
10:18  bavardage> I want to use the theme that the user loaded
10:18  jd_> in a module ?
10:18  bavardage> yup
10:18  jd_> you've 2 ways to achieve this
10:19  j:Senses3:(~Senses3@cpe-98-27-169-85.neo.res.rr.com)
10:19  bavardage> right...
10:19  jd_> either make the user give the theme it loaded via a function, like awful does
10:19  bavardage> yeah...
10:19  farhaven> bavardage: look at invaders :)
10:19  bavardage> farhaven: oh kk
10:19  jd_> or just use awful, since the users already registered the theme in awful (if it uses awful, which most users does)
10:19  farhaven> but listen to jd_ first
10:19  Senses3> ok so im on irc on a different computer so i can kill x and see what output it gives me when i try to start awesome
10:19  bavardage> I am currently looking at menu, but it doesn't seem to work
10:19  jd_> awful.beautiful.get does that IIRC
10:19  Garoth> Senses3: use a command line irc client on a VT :)
10:20  bavardage> sec, I'll pastebin
10:20  jd_> bavardage: invaders use it, you can use that as an example
10:20  j:pyrho:(~pyrho@pyrho.ath.cx)
10:20  pyrho> hey all
10:20  Garoth> Hey there, pyrho 
10:20  bavardage> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/90373/
10:20  pyrho> hi bavardage (:
10:20  bavardage> I'll go look at invaders
10:20  bavardage> pyrho: hai
10:20  bavardage> long time no see :P
10:20  pyrho> yep ^^
10:21  jd_> bavardage: what do you get with that code ?
10:21  pyrho> I was wondering anyone managed to update the "urgent" state of a tag with irssi (like when you get a new message) ?
10:21  bavardage> testing theme omg
10:21  bavardage> then
10:21  bavardage> "nil"
10:22  farhaven> hmm
10:22  farhaven> it looks ok though
10:22  bavardage> hrmm
10:22  bavardage> there a succint way to see the keys of a table?
10:22  jd_> depends if you used awful.beautiful.register() BEFORE calling load_theme()
10:22  bavardage> oooh
10:22  farhaven> do you execute that piece of code before or after loading the theme with beautiful.init?
10:22  bavardage> that may be the problem
10:22  farhaven> lol
10:22  farhaven> damn
10:22  bavardage> *goes to look at rc.lua*
10:22  jd_> :)
10:23  farhaven> that happens if i just type along and hit enter :D
10:23  Garoth> farhaven: accidental code?
10:24  farhaven> nope, i meant repeating what jd said :)
10:24  tsdh> jd_: Hi, your last commit fixed my Mod-Tab with fullscreen layout.  But still Mod-Tab won't raise the prevouis window in float layout.
10:24  farhaven> hmm
10:24  farhaven> weird thing here
10:25  farhaven> if I have open office impress on my second screen and a tooltip appears, it is displayed on the first screen
10:25  jd_> 2 euros question
10:25  farhaven> but on the same relative position as it would have been on the 2nd
10:25  jd_> that would interest people if I had an option to change ellipsize mode in textbox ?
10:25  tsdh> jd_: Ah, but that seems to be independent of my output/screen.
10:25  bavardage> hah
10:25  bavardage> yup
10:25  bavardage> 'twas the problem :D
10:25  bavardage> ty
10:25  farhaven> ellipsize?
10:25  jd_> tsdh: yes, modkey-tab does _not_ raise, that's not in the code
10:26  jd_> tsdh: but fullscreen and max layouts raises automagically
10:26  koniu> jd_: whatsize?
10:26  tsdh> jd_: I see.  Thanks a lot.
10:26  Garoth> ellipsize?
10:27  koniu> haha god spoke everyone got rly excited
10:27  koniu> now eat the anticipation
10:27  koniu> he obviously made it up just to test how mainy faithful are there
10:27  pyrho> x)
10:28  Cosmonaut> 2 euros? that's like a hundred bucks now, right?!
10:28  Garoth> Hahaha
10:29  Garoth> ....!!
10:29  koniu> ellipsize = el lip size
10:29  koniu> something in spanglish
10:29  Garoth> Mmmm.... lip size...
10:29  Garoth> Wait, eww
10:30  koniu> yeah, in textbox...
10:30  *** Garoth imagines woman with oversized lips
10:30  jd_> http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-Layout-Objects.html#PangoEllipsizeMode 
10:30  jd_> lamers!
10:30  Cosmonaut> Garoth: Angelina Jolie
10:30  koniu> i'm too lazy to google
10:30  Cosmonaut> lol
10:31  koniu> YEA!
10:31  Cosmonaut> gnome.org?!
10:31  koniu> ekhm
10:31  koniu> xD
10:31  Cosmonaut> awesome 2.x had something like this right?
10:31  Garoth> Cosmonaut: well... we do use pango
10:31  jd_> pango is good
10:32  Cosmonaut> when my textboxes were too small I had ellipsis in awesome 2.3.4
10:32  jd_> there still in a3 but that's done by pango
10:32  Senses3> anyone have any idea where something called shifty is
10:32  jd_> and it does it better.
10:32  Senses3> i believe it's a beautiful theme
10:32  koniu> wtf
10:32  Senses3> and it's the reason my awesome config isn't loading
10:32  jd_> it's a koniu module, isn't it?
10:32  Garoth> Senses3: lol, yes
10:32  Senses3> no idea
10:32  koniu> yea
10:32  Cosmonaut> ahh ok
10:33  Senses3> but i can't find anything for awesome on google because of the name
10:33  Garoth> jd_: they should really name that "PangoLoseTextMysteriouslyMode"
10:33  koniu> Senses3: that's a module for dynamic tagging not a theme
10:33  Senses3> even though it's an awesome name
10:33  jd_> so the question is would people interested for such a configuration, I wonder :)
10:33  Senses3> ah
10:33  jd_> Garoth: haha
10:33  Senses3> do you know where to get it?
10:33  Garoth> I wouldn't personally be too interested, but maybe one day?
10:33  Garoth> Senses3: yes, but how have you heard of it if you don't have it? :)
10:33  q:linduxed:(~linduxed@wpa-150.kthopen.kth.se)
10:34  Senses3> premade rc.lua depends on it
10:34  koniu> no way
10:34  Garoth> Heh.
10:34  Garoth> koniu: +1 no way
10:34  Garoth> Senses3: anyway, it's on git.mercenariesguild.net
10:34  koniu> :P
10:34  Senses3> awesome
10:34  Senses3> ty
10:34  Garoth> In the awesome.git project, branch shifty
10:34  jd_> well anyway it should not be so hard to implement
10:35  farhaven> jd_: um
10:35  farhaven> don't textboxes do that already?
10:35  koniu> farhaven: yea, he just wants to give conf options
10:35  koniu> i assume
10:35  farhaven> ah
10:35  jd_> you're assuming well
10:35  jd_> no the end of the text is truncated with …
10:36  jd_> but you can choose to truncate the middle of the start
10:36  jd_> s/of/or/
10:36  jd_> or not at all
10:36  farhaven> mmh
10:36  farhaven> that's cool
10:36  farhaven> do it :D
10:36  jd_> I'm testing middle and I think it's nice
10:36  q:weechat3:(l1dst4h@ANantes-257-1-23-159.w90-25.abo.wanadoo.fr)
10:36  j:weechat3:(l1dst4h@ANantes-257-1-71-23.w90-25.abo.wanadoo.fr)
10:36  jd_> for title windows it does this with my irss: jd_#awesome(+nt) [Welcome…Plastic Trees' 3.0 released]
10:37  koniu> jd_: and while you're at it why don't u add 'padding' to widget
10:37  *** koniu cheeky
10:37  jd_> koniu: 'cause it's useless and I already removed it weeks ago ? :)
10:37  koniu> jd_: how's it useless
10:37  Garoth> Wait, you _removed_ padding?!
10:38  Garoth> I've written a text area object that's just a space in order to have padding :S
10:38  farhaven> jd_: could you also make the string by which the truncated text is marked configurable?
10:38  Cosmonaut> Garoth: zomgoggles, hacker!
10:38  farhaven> lol
10:39  farhaven> but yeah, i have that too
10:39  koniu> padding table with all four sides, c'mon... why not
10:39  jd_> farhaven: what?
10:39  jd_> Garoth: there's also <margin> markup :)
10:39  koniu> instead of '..'
10:40  Garoth> jd_: yeah, probably, but it's not obvious when you, say, have an image object
10:40  koniu> ok that's what u mean pango is good
10:40  farhaven> jd_: i mean replacing the ? as a truncation character with something like "..."
10:40  koniu> let's see it
10:40  Garoth> Though I'm getting the impression that all these different objects are really just the same thing
10:40  Garoth> And stored as a string with markup
10:40  jd_> farhaven: the ? you see a question mark ?
10:40  koniu> he means '..' i think
10:41  jd_> it's '…'
10:41  jd_> not ?
10:41  jd_> I don't think you can change that, I'll check
10:41  farhaven> yeah, I see a question mark there
10:41  farhaven> what was it intended to be?
10:42  koniu> it's like two dots but not really
10:42  koniu> in one char
10:42  koniu> ellipsis
10:42  koniu> the pango way
10:43  Garoth> Ellipse, according to English grammar, is ". . ." -- with slightly widened spaces in between the dots
10:43  koniu> yeah, that's what i thought
10:43  Garoth> But I suppose it's not really a hard rule.
10:43  koniu> but the discussion about '?' is a classic anyway
10:43  jd_> it's 3 dots in one char, actually
10:43  koniu> lol
10:43  koniu> i see two
10:43  koniu> in the terminal anyway
10:43  Garoth> Oh, that makes sense.
10:43  jd_> if you see 2 dots or a question mark, you've a font problem :)
10:43  j:farhaven_:(~gregor@Qf7ca.q.pppool.de)
10:43  koniu> yup, terminus
10:44  jd_> it's a UTF-8 char for ...
10:44  Garoth> termisucx
10:44  Garoth> Oh wait, that's what I use :S
10:44  Garoth> I'm really having a hard time picking a console font S:
10:44  koniu> it does suck
10:44  ~:farhaven >> Guest1857
10:44  ~:farhaven_ >> farhaven
10:45  koniu> but most of the time looks easy
10:45  farhaven> hmm
10:45  farhaven> i need a new terminal font :/
10:45  Garoth> jd_: also, horizontal widgets in a vertical wibox?
10:45  Garoth> I know some people who like that kind of thing. Is it possible?
10:45  koniu> Garoth: aw yeah!
10:45  farhaven> Garoth: or other way round
10:46  Garoth> farhaven: lol, yeah :)
10:46  farhaven> that would allow to place widgets on top of each other in floating wiboxes
10:46  koniu> <3
10:46  koniu> widgets on top of each other
10:48  farhaven> heh, that would allow some kind of windowmaker like vertical launchbar
10:49  Garoth> Cosmonaut: So, the awesome package maintainer got back to me and said... "We generate those using namcap which uses ldd and that's the way it's done."
10:49  Garoth> Fair enough.
10:49  Garoth> (for the deps list)
10:49  koniu> lol yeah let's open loads of feature requests, xmas is coming gotta make the list
10:49  Vinnonet> Any one using the terminus font with awesome??
10:50  q:Guest1857:(~gregor@Qea9f.q.pppool.de)
10:50  jd_> Garoth: that's planned
10:51  koniu> \o/
10:52  Garoth> jd_: \o/
10:52  Garoth> Vinnonet: I have a friend who's using it as the awesome font, yes
10:52  Garoth> I personally don't though.
10:52  Garoth> (Just for terminals)
10:53  Senses3> so is there a git file for shifty?
10:53  Vinnonet> Some reason, i cant get the sizeing to work in awesome but works fine with in urxvt
10:53  Senses3> cause i cant find it on mercenariesguild
10:53  Garoth> jd_: So do you have a plan for what constitutes 3.1? Because at this rate, there are so many new features it pretty much constitutes v5 :P
10:53  Garoth> Senses3: git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/awesome.git
10:53  Garoth> Go into the new folder and:
10:53  Garoth> git checkout -b shifty origin/shifty
10:54  koniu> lol
10:54  Garoth> Senses3: http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/shifty
10:54  koniu> Garoth: you and your git
10:54  Garoth> And there is the web for it.
10:54  Garoth> http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome.git;a=blob;f=lib/shifty.lua.in;h=f6cb8df87e48e3a283334b208aee1284831c0530;hb=613bd0c4be97b3cb2970f6aa904b489ef97a78c8
10:54  Garoth> And there is the latest file itself.
10:54  j:Marenz:(~anonym001@vpn-stud.rz-zw.fh-kl.de)
10:54  Senses3> oh nice
10:55  Senses3> thanks
10:55  Garoth> Cheers.
10:55  koniu> thanks. but, Senses3, no offence if you couldnt find it in git i dont think u should use it, it's prerelease quality code and it's not a complete piece of cake.
10:55  Garoth> Senses3: and koniu there wrote it, so interrogate him about it
10:55  jd_> Garoth: I've a TODO  with random ideas actually
10:55  koniu> haha managed to make a disc1amer 1st :>
10:56  Garoth> Yep.
10:56  Senses3> maybe i should use a different rc.lua
10:56  Senses3> hahah
10:56  Garoth> jd_: So when the TODO ends, we get 3.1? :)
10:56  Garoth> Senses3: perhaps start with the default one?
10:56  Senses3> i don't really have time to write my own
10:56  koniu> Senses3: yeah, don't use my config to start with bad bad idea
10:56  Senses3> true
10:56  jd_> Garoth: yeah, only 2 items left :)
10:56  Garoth> The default isn't bad, and it's easy to mod
10:56  Garoth> jd_: oh sweet
10:56  jd_> Garoth: others items get moved to 3.2 since they were too heavy
10:56  Garoth> Great stuff :D
10:56  koniu> unless theres sb else dipping in shifty too
10:57  Garoth> We'll spread the word of 3.1 far and wide, oh pope of awesomeness, jd_ 
10:57  bavardage> :D
10:57  jd_> amen
10:57  koniu> erm
10:57  Garoth> Senses3: if you're using the git version of awesome, you can get the default config (after you've installed) from /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua
10:57  koniu> so how do you do this margin?
10:58  Garoth> koniu: my guess is <margin>2</margin> in a text?
10:58  Cosmonaut> wow, 3.1
10:58  Cosmonaut> cool
10:58  bavardage> Garoth: did I screw up again (has just commited)
10:58  Garoth> Cosmonaut: not yet, Hahaha
10:58  Cosmonaut> where is the TODO exactly?
10:58  Cosmonaut> or should I read further back
10:58  Garoth> Cosmonaut: on his computer :P
10:58  Cosmonaut> lol
10:58  Senses3> yeah i have the default config backed up
10:58  koniu> Cosmonaut: there's bits in his blog
10:58  Cosmonaut> well 2 items.. I wonder what those are
10:58  Garoth> Senses3: it's a decent config to start modding
10:58  Garoth> jd_: yeah, maybe a roadmap on the wiki would be not too bad
10:58  Senses3> i replaced it in /etc/xdg/awesome because it wasn't loading my config in ~/.config
10:58  Garoth> Considering you're not entirely alone now
10:58  ~:weechat3 >> leeed
10:59  koniu> Garoth: ^2
10:59  Cosmonaut> blog...?
10:59  Garoth> koniu: oh, sorry
10:59  Garoth> Cosmonaut: Hahaha
10:59  Cosmonaut> link!
10:59  jd_> Garoth: maybe :)
10:59  jd_> Garoth: the thing is that I'd like to have a real tool to handle my tasks
10:59  Senses3> ok cool now it's loading that i replaced it in .config
10:59  jd_> like redmine
10:59  koniu> Garoth: sorry? i was just saying that roadmap*roadmap
10:59  Garoth> bavardage: never thought I'd see the day, but your commit is just right :)
11:00  farhaven> lol
11:00  Garoth> jd_: we use Collabtive here at work. It's not bad.
11:00  Cosmonaut> lol
11:00  Garoth> ;)
11:00  Cosmonaut> I use JIRA at work
11:00  bavardage> Garoth: :D
11:00  Cosmonaut> wait wait, so where is this blog?
11:00  bavardage> is the roadmap online?
11:00  farhaven> bavardage: one thing would make your commits even cooler :)
11:00  damjan> I see in the latest -git name="xxx" is removed from the widgets
11:01  q:efleming969:(0c164aaa@webchat.mibbit.com)
11:01  farhaven> place a "radical:" or something in front of the title, so one can see what the commit is for instantly
11:01  Garoth> Redmine looks nice.
11:01  Garoth> bavardage: no
11:01  bavardage> Garoth: no, what?
11:01  Garoth> bavardage: no, the roadmap is not online at the moment
11:01  bavardage> no to there being a roadmap?
11:01  bavardage> oh kk
11:01  bavardage> :(
11:02  bavardage> I wanted to get my anticipation up
11:02  Cosmonaut> is this blog top secret?
11:02  farhaven> wasn't there some kind of todo on the mailing list some time ago?
11:02  Garoth> bavardage: yes you should put radical: in front so that when it gets merged with stuff, it's obvious (see jd's commits)
11:02  jd_> Garoth: I'd like something which is easily installable into Apache without runing whole web server in ruby :/
11:02  Garoth> jd_: yeah.... :S
11:02  Cosmonaut> ruby = evil
11:02  Garoth> Maybe collabtive would be better
11:02  Garoth> Cosmonaut: ruby's fine, rails is kind of evil though

11:12  jd_> damjan: in your conf
11:12  Garoth> damjan: first one that executes will claim it
11:12  damjan> right ... ok I get it.. I was confused previously
11:12  damjan> it's the whole wibox that's applied to a screen
11:12  damjan> wibox.screen = 
11:12  Garoth> Yep.

11:15  damjan> let me see how that works
11:16  koniu> farhaven: i have a layoutbox there too!
11:16  farhaven> omgwtfthief :D
11:16  Garoth> damjan: a layoutbox is just an image box that changes image when layout changes
11:16  Garoth> And the images are named with the layout names.
11:16  Garoth> For easy hackery.
11:17  farhaven> hmm
11:17  bavardage> that ellipsize makes no sense
11:17  Garoth> bavardage: it makes perfect sense.
11:17  farhaven> a screen with no wiboxes at all looks cool too
11:17  Garoth> If the text is too long, it gets cut off with ...
11:17  damjan> makes sense, tags -> the layout for the tag -> the tasklist for the tag

11:31  koniu> sexy
11:32  koniu> will look
11:34  jd_> one item left!
11:34  CIA-6> awesome: Julien Danjou  * r4c5a6b1df28a /luaa.c: luaa: add support for meta __ipairs
11:34  farhaven> what is it?
11:34  *** jd_ is almost rewriting lua
11:34  bavardage> haha
11:34  farhaven> hehe
11:34  bavardage> you should have embedded python instead tbh :P
11:34  jd_> and guess would have a sexy but with all that!
11:35  jd_> bavardage: I don't think so :)
11:35  bavardage> whyever not :P
11:35  bavardage> python is nicer than lua
11:35  jd_> s/would/who will/
11:35  erikg> bavardage: python has serious problems
11:35  jd_> bavardage: not for embedding
11:35  dpb> And python is usually installed on every distro already. No need to install another language.
11:35  erikg> exactly
11:35  koniu> wow that was so easy
11:35  erikg> dpb: i don't think python is a good choice for embedding
11:35  farhaven> lol, that 200kb
11:36  Garoth> Python's fine for embedding.
11:36  erikg> python gobbles memory
11:37  dpb> So does your mom!
11:37  Garoth> Personally, I can't say I care, and I'm not sure how well founded that claim is when you're comparing to other scripting languages
11:37  jd_> stop it or I'll embed PHP.
11:37  w00t> dooooooooo it
11:37  erikg> forth plz
11:37  farhaven> lol
11:37  farhaven> lisp would be cool :)
11:37  koniu> jd_: would you be intersted in a patch allowing selecting block or underline cursor in awful prompt?
11:38  Garoth> Oh god, not lisp
11:38  Gigamo> ruby!
11:38  erikg> can i get a visual basic?
11:38  dpb> jd_: use html and javascript. kthx.
11:38  Gigamo> EMBED RUBY!
11:38  jd_> koniu: why not
11:38  j:xeno:(~xeno@thehappy.de)
11:38  Gigamo> :)
11:38  Garoth> Anyway, lua's fine.
11:38  farhaven> yep, easy to learn and powerful
11:38  koniu> jd_: ok, gonna code it in properly then
11:38  koniu> lua ftw
11:38  farhaven> and it has some unique concepts, which makes it more interesting :)
11:39  erikg> table table table
11:39  Gigamo> lol
11:39  erikg> does anyone have a script to produce a .deb package out of the awesome src tree?
11:40  jd_> debuild ?
11:40  Garoth> erikg: http://git.debian.org/?p=users/acid/awesome.git;a=summary ?
11:40  jd_> or git clone git://git.debian.org/git/users/acid/awesome.git

11:47  farhaven> hmm?
11:47  Garoth> Where firefox spawned a dialog on a different tag
11:47  farhaven> ah
11:47  Garoth> Maybe someone else said it
11:47  Garoth> That's pretty screwy
11:47  farhaven> well, not on a different tag, on a different screen
11:47  j:iamFIREcracker:(~qwerty@host-78-12-101-221.cust-adsl.tiscali.it)

11:51  farhaven> tychoish: or better, try bitlbee :)

11:52  tychoish> what's the catch
11:52  bavardage> uhm, catch?
11:52  bavardage> you gotta not be bothered about seeing people's DPs 
11:52  bavardage> or sending files over msn
11:52  tychoish> DPs?
11:53  bavardage> display pictures
11:53  farhaven> or avatars, as they are commonly called :O)
11:53  farhaven> -O
11:53  tychoish> I'm fine with that
11:53  bavardage> pfft msn calls them display pictures
11:53  farhaven> yeah, but msn sucks

12:19  Garoth> koniu: and I guess this is that mysterious "prompt" branch :)
12:20  koniu> Garoth: allows you to underline the cursor in awful.prompt
12:21  Garoth> What does that mean?
12:22  koniu> doh prtscr doesn't work when keygrabber's running
12:22  koniu> well you know run prompt, or lua prompt
12:23  Garoth> Yes.
12:23  koniu> it has a cursor which by default is a block cursor
12:23  CIA-6> awesome: koniu  * rd4bfaa859808 /lib/awful/prompt.lua.in: awful.prompt: add underline style to in run() args
12:23  Garoth> Yes.
12:24  koniu> ul_cursor allows you to change it to underscore cursor
12:24  jd_> hum I think I'll give up on last item
12:24  Garoth> Oh, uhm... okay.
12:24  Garoth> jd_: ?!
12:24  koniu> what is the last item
12:24  jd_> it's not very important and I'm a bit lazy, I'll see tomorrow, or maybe I'll release rc1
12:24  jd_> *WHO KNOWS*
12:24  Garoth> What is it? :)
12:25  jd_> Garoth: rewrite table.insert to support special table like the wtable
12:25  koniu> why do you need to do it
12:25  jd_> 'cause currently table.insert(mywibox.widgets, 42) fails miserably
12:25  j:badger:(badger@satgnu.net)
12:25  jd_> because it does raw acces to the table
12:26  jd_> which is baaad.
12:26  jd_> but now I'm stuck because lua does not support __len metafield
12:26  koniu> aha
12:26  jd_> which should be implemented in Lua 5.2
12:26  j:bsag:(~bsag@82-69-12-139.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk)
12:26  jd_> or I can implement it in awesome but … I don't want to!
12:26  jd_> I already implemented __next, __pairs, __ipairs.
12:27  koniu> yeah, i've seen comments redoing taglist.new
12:27  Garoth> Hahaha
12:27  jd_> so I'm beginning to write a big extension to Lua with all that stuff
12:27  jd_> I'll fork my own language next year at this rate
12:27  koniu> i wish someone explained what __stuff is
12:27  damjan> BTW client.focus:raise() (modkey-j/k) throws a warning on empty tags
12:27  jd_> well they are field of metatables
12:28  koniu> what are they for
12:28  jd_> so with that, if you setmetatable(mytag, { __ipairs = ipairs_function_for_tag })
12:28  jd_> then when you will for k, v in ipairs(mytag) do… it will call ipairs_function_for_tag
12:28  jd_> same for next, and pairs.
12:28  badger> apologies for interrupting proper talk with a foolish question, but: can anyone tell me why I get "failed to open display" when trying to run awesome as any user? 
12:29  Garoth> Yay, badger !

12:29  jd_> going back home now!

12:30  farhaven> um
12:30  farhaven> mmh
12:30  farhaven> good question
12:30  Garoth> badger: have you tried starting awesome the "startx" way btw?
12:30  badger> hmm, no
12:31  koniu> try that and see what it says in the console
12:31  Garoth> badger: please try that, it's easier to debug
12:31  Garoth> And what's in your .xinitrc?
12:32  Garoth> (the startx way is to kill your x, switch to a vt, and type "startx", which runs your .xinitrc)
12:32  koniu> cat: .xinitrc: No such file or directory
12:32  koniu> that's a bit presumptious
12:32  Garoth> koniu: he's on arch
12:32  koniu> ...of me
12:32  koniu> XP
12:32  Garoth> Don't you know? I have Arch sense like I have Git sense?
12:33  badger> well what d'you know
12:33  badger> it works like this
12:33  badger> o_O
12:33  koniu> that's deffo easier to debug ;p
12:33  Garoth> Hahaha
12:33  Garoth> Silly Slim
12:33  badger> well
12:33  badger> running "awesome" also failed :P
12:34  Garoth> running awesome in a VT failed?
12:34  badger> yep
12:34  Garoth> well... duh, there is no X :P
12:34  badger> hmmm
12:34  koniu> run 'X' in one vt
12:34  badger> that is a good point
12:34  koniu> then in another one run DISPLAY=:0.0 awesome
12:34  Garoth> (You can't run gui programs without X, and window managers aren't exempt)
12:34  koniu> and watch output :)
12:34  badger> Garoth: framebuffer! :P
12:35  Garoth> badger: well, yeah, kinda
12:35  Garoth> koniu: tail -f .xinitrc :S
12:35  Garoth> err, no
12:35  bsag> awesome noob here: any recommendations for a widget manager?
12:35  Garoth> tail -f .xsession-errors
12:35  q:sm217:(~sm@92.112.46.2)
12:35  Garoth> bash: ... what's a widget manager?
12:35  bsag> i'm looking at wicked and amazing
12:35  Garoth> Oh, I see.
12:35  Garoth> bash: sorry
12:35  bash> :)
12:35  bash> np
12:35  *** badger wonders why Garoth's autocomplete lists bash first
12:36  bash> lol
12:36  bash> true, why? :D
12:36  Garoth> ba ~ bs
12:36  bash> bad > bas
12:36  bash> ah
12:36  bash> ok
12:36  bsag> i mean one of the libraries to assist in making status bar widgets
12:37  koniu> bsag: i think former is for v3 and the latter for v2, might be wrong
12:37  bsag> ah, ok. good point
12:37  bsag> i'm on 3.0-1, so that narrows it down.
12:38  Garoth> bsag: yeah, though you should update to the git version
12:38  koniu> here we go
12:38  bsag> Garoth: git version of awesome or wicked (or both)?
12:39  Garoth> bsag: both
12:39  Garoth> bsag: we're really close to 3.1 of awesome, so 3.0 is really lacking features
12:40  p:cYmen_:(~cymen@squint.a-oben.org)
12:40  bsag> Garoth: thanks, i'll do that. or maybe wait for 3.1 and see what goodies it brings!
12:40  Garoth> bsag: lots and lots of goodies :)
12:41  Garoth> But in general, I think it's wise to have the git version if you hang out here
12:41  tychoish> bsag uses awesome? 
12:41  Garoth> Most people here use it and it's easier to answer questions about the latest.
12:41  bsag> tychoish: hi!
12:41  j:jonkristian:(~jonkristi@240.80-202-222.nextgentel.com)
12:41  tychoish> I thought you were a mac gal ;) 
12:41  bsag> tychoish: yes - in VMFusion. having a lot of fun with it.
12:41  tychoish> the internet is really too small for fords
12:41  leeed> Garoth: 3.1 changelist on jd_'s blog are.. ahem.. awesome ;)
12:42  tychoish> s/fords/words/
12:42  leeed> floating wiboxes, yummy
12:42  bsag> tychoish: i certainly am a mac gal, but i do enjoy playing in linux too
12:42  tychoish> bsag: I started to use awesome in vmware on my macbook, and I somehow eneded up with linux box and two extra monitors
12:42  farhaven> yep, they rock, leeed :)
12:43  farhaven> lol
12:43  leeed> ^^
12:43  Garoth> tychoish: lol, yeah :)
12:43  bsag> tychoish: having used awesome for a few days, i can see how that could happen ;-)
12:43  bsag> addictive...
12:43  koniu> hey how do you do a screencast easily
12:43  tychoish> koniu: I don't, really
12:43  farhaven> import -window root foo.png
12:43  farhaven> :)
12:43  koniu> video
12:44  farhaven> ah, cast
12:44  tychoish> bsag: my biggest mac-to-awesome conversion issue is textmate 
12:44  leeed> just put awesome  on my gf's computer (for my own user account but she was interested ;p ) coz I couldn't stand gnome metacity anymore :)
12:44  farhaven> lol
12:44  bsag> tychoish: i think that would be mine too, though i can get along ok in vim.
12:44  Garoth> koniu: import -window root foo.png in a loop :P
12:44  damjan> qt-record-my-desktop
12:44  koniu> lol
12:44  farhaven> hehe
12:45  tychoish> yeah, emacs is a bit more textmate like, but that's the biggest challenge
12:45  j:kopp_:(~kopp@AGrenoble-152-1-64-151.w83-201.abo.wanadoo.fr)
12:46  bsag> tychoish: see, i never could get along with emacs. feel like i'm tying my finger in knots.
12:46  *** bsag ducks to avoid emacs:vi holy war
12:46  Garoth> bsag: Vim!
12:46  *** gregf tosses his Vim gang sign
12:47  bsag> Garoth: oops. yes, vim ;-D
12:47  gregf> http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/473801152/ :)
12:47  tychoish> yeah, no, awesome's a very vim-centric world, and I'm totally fine with that
12:47  q:kopp:(~kopp@AGrenoble-152-1-28-241.w82-122.abo.wanadoo.fr)
12:47  stillunknown> What does vim have to do with awesome?
12:48  Garoth> I think he means a lot of awesome users use vim?
12:48  Garoth> gregf: lol!
12:48  tychoish> yes, of course
12:49  Gigamo> talking about editors, anyone know which font this is? http://people.cs.vt.edu/~codemac/shots/vtree.png
12:49  koniu> isnt it terminus?
12:49  tychoish> monaco, without sharpening
12:49  bsag> a lot of the default keybindings are quite vim-like
12:49  damjan> Q: can I have a window (the roster of psi) always the same size and position on tag3, while the other psi windows (which are always on tag 3 too) to use some of the layout managers
12:50  leeed> bsag, yup, mod4+h/j/k/l ;p
12:50  tychoish> bsag: that's what I was after, also lots of folks use vimperator 
12:50  farhaven> yep
12:50  leeed> first thing I thought when I first started awesome and read the manpages :p
12:50  farhaven> vimperator > *
12:50  tychoish> monaco is a great font
12:51  bsag> i'll have to try vimperator
12:51  Garoth> +1 vimperator
12:51  leeed> farhaven: did same with opera (yeah, i know, but i'm used to it ;) ) thnks to calmar tutorial on his webpage
12:51  stillunknown> damjan: I think that would require a new special layout, which haven't yet been lua'fied yet.
12:51  koniu> monaco? O_o
12:52  damjan> curenlty I have the roster floating, but other windows go underneath it
12:52  tychoish> koniu: yep, pretty sure
12:52  Garoth> damjan: yeah, the layouts code is kind of old and weak. Still straight from dwm.
12:52  koniu> tychoish: the editor font?
12:52  farhaven> Garoth: really?
12:52  farhaven> oldschool :)
12:52  Garoth> farhaven: unfortunately...
12:53  tychoish> yes, it's a mac font, Susan Kare? or whatever her name designed it. Incolasta (or whatever) is a reasonable knockoff 
12:53  koniu> ur talking about the gui font tho, not the editor right?
12:53  bsag> tychoish: Inconsolata? that's what i'm using. quite like it.
12:54  tychoish> clearly I haven't done exhaustive research on the subject
12:54  tychoish> koniu: I was talking about the editor font 
12:54  koniu> that's cool
12:54  tychoish> bash: Inconsolata, thats it! I use the Andriod fonts, the monospace is pretty good save for nonslashed 0s 
12:55  koniu> do you know any good monospace fonts that look good when they're really small?
12:55  bsag> tychoish: eh, i can't live without me slashed 0s :-)
12:55  j:ba_sh:(~bash@89-97-140-221.ip17.fastwebnet.it)
12:55  bsag> even do them in real life when writing
12:55  tychoish> I'd use Monaco if it were in some format that I could translate to linux 
12:56  koniu> there's a ttf version no?
12:57  koniu> http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/monaco/monaco/mac-ttf/7120/
12:57  koniu> or is mac truetype different fmt with same extension
12:57  tychoish> I've not been able to copy it over successfully 
12:58  Garoth> My god!
12:58  Garoth> Inconsolata looks like exactly what I've always wanted!
12:59  farhaven> mmh
12:59  Garoth> tychoish: lol, you ping'd bash like I did. Sorry bash.
12:59  q:codders:(~at@octomonkey.org.uk)
13:00  tychoish> they're "dfonts" 
13:00  bsag> heh, i probably wouldn't know if you'd pinged me properly
13:00  bsag> my first time driving irssi, and i'm like a monkey driving a tractor!
13:01  stillunknown> tychoish: What made you leave osx?
13:01  tychoish> I haven't totally left
13:02  q:bash:(~bash@89-97-140-221.ip17.fastwebnet.it)
13:02  stillunknown> awesome and osx seem like two very different worlds
13:02  Garoth> Yeah... that's true
13:03  Garoth> Yay, inconsolata happens to be in the repos :P
13:03  tychoish> I still have a macbook that I use a fair piece (largely because of textmate, and because I can't replace it yet) but awesome + cost + I'm a very unix-y os x user, and linux is a bit more reliable in that resepect 
13:04  Garoth> tychoish: Linux on the macbook.
13:04  *** Garoth nods
13:05  tychoish> I'll probably trade up to a linux laptop in a year/18 months 
13:05  tychoish> but for now, it's all good
13:05  Garoth> tychoish: in the mean while, use macvim
13:05  Garoth> ;)
13:05  tychoish> or console emacs ;)
13:05  Garoth> \/ /
13:06  Garoth> tychoish: don't you mac users prefer to use gui programs?
13:06  Garoth> </discrimination>
13:06  tychoish> :) 
13:06  stillunknown> Your only supposed to say that when they're gone.
13:06  tychoish> I just need good, simple blogging support in a text editor. 
13:06  tychoish> this mac user uses mutt :) 
13:06  stillunknown> blogging in a text editor, huh?
13:07  stillunknown> specific blogging support i should say
13:07  Gigamo> so how does one display monaco without sharpening?
13:07  tychoish> seriously mod+ctrl+p = posts a blog post. I *yearn* for that 
13:07  jd_> what's better in textmate than in gvim?
13:07  Garoth> tychoish: I use vim with the blog plugin
13:07  Gigamo> i have it by installing ttf-mac-fonts from AUR :P
13:07  bsag> Garoth: i do, but in my VM archlinux i seem to have only 2 gui progs: opera and evince.
13:08  Garoth> bsag: huh?
13:08  koniu> hmmm, how do tell rxvt not to antialias the xft font?
13:08  bsag> i quite like extremes: extreme eyecandy in macos x and extreme command-liney-ness in linux
13:09  bsag> Garoth: archlinux running in VMWare Fusion on Mac
13:09  stillunknown> A while back i installed kubuntu 8.10 somewhere, too much eye-candy imo.
13:10  Garoth> bsag: alright.
13:10  tychoish> http://fosswire.com/2008/05/20/extract-mac-font-files-dfont-into-ttf-files/
13:10  koniu> or in other words, i've installed inconoclasta, how do i use it now, it looks ugly
13:10  koniu> lol
13:11  koniu> just discovered that i'm using font called 6x13
13:11  koniu> mighty fast
13:11  j:bavardage:(~bavardage@87.115.70.53)
13:12  stillunknown> That must be fixed.
13:12  koniu> oh cool, bavardage how do u make a screencast like that thing o youdupe
13:12  farhaven> koniu: yup, inconofoo is ugly
13:12  farhaven> i stay with monospace/fixed :)
13:12  koniu> yeah fixed here
13:12  stillunknown> As far as ttf fonts go, microsoft has some good ones.
13:13  koniu> xft is so slow
13:13  dpb> terminus <2
13:13  Garoth> tychoish: http://www.flickr.com/photos/keynote/403175598/
13:13  Gigamo> how did you turn off antialiasing for an urxvt font again?
13:13  damjan> why?
13:14  Gigamo> because I want to? ^^
13:14  damjan> that sucks :)
13:14  bavardage> koniu: I use recordmydesktop
13:14  bavardage> well, 'gtk-recordmydesktop'
13:14  bavardage> you on arch?
13:14  Gigamo> tried urxvt*font: xft:Monaco:pixelsize=8:antialiasing=false but its still antialiased :P
13:14  koniu> ah yes, i got it
13:15  koniu> antialias=false
13:15  koniu> ?
13:15  koniu> not sure, don't like xft
13:15  stillunknown> koniu: if you think xft is slow, then pango must be even slower
13:15  Gigamo> nope, that didnt do it either
13:15  q:farhaven:(~gregor@Qf7ca.q.pppool.de)
13:16  j:snowj:(~weechat@dslb-088-069-190-226.pools.arcor-ip.net)
13:16  snowj> lo'
13:16  koniu> stillunknown: yeah but i don't use pango for terminal
13:16  dpb> urxvt uses xft? o_O
13:16  Gigamo> it can
13:16  *** stillunknown tries to stay away from anything using core X fonts
13:16  j:farhaven:(~gregor@Qf7ca.q.pppool.de)
13:17  farhaven> hehe
13:17  farhaven> fixed-10 for urxvt rocks
13:18  *** stillunknown uses sakura as terminal
13:19  q:nisc:(~nisc@sedanet0.sedan.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE)
13:19  stillunknown> Which uses vte as it's backend.
13:19  stillunknown> (much like most gtk based terminals)
13:21  Garoth> stillunknown: yeah, me too
13:22  Garoth> Though I'm getting the impression that fonts are getting screwed up
13:22  Garoth> Ever had anything like that? They're, like.. blurry.
13:22  stillunknown> screenshot?
13:23  Garoth> stillunknown: and the spacing gets screwed up occasionally.
13:23  j:codders:(~at@octomonkey.org.uk)
13:24  stillunknown> nvidia?
13:24  Garoth> stillunknown: ATI
13:25  stillunknown> Only sakura has these issues?
13:25  Garoth> stillunknown: gnome term too (same library)
13:25  stillunknown> But no other apps?
13:25  Garoth> Nope.
13:25  Garoth> Awesome seems fine, but I haven't tested extensively
13:26  Garoth> stillunknown: okay, managed some screenshots
13:29  bsag> got to go. thanks for the advice!
13:29  p:bsag:(~bsag@82-69-12-139.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk)

13:30  koniu> nasty
13:30  stillunknown> I'm using fixed as font btw.
13:30  koniu> that's what i saw
13:31  Garoth> Also, anyone recommend a good command line ftp client?
13:31  Gigamo> so I found the font, but it looks ugly because its being drawn by xft
13:31  Gigamo> hmmmmz
13:31  koniu> lftp i recall
13:31  Garoth> koniu: tried it, wasn't overly impressed
13:31  farhaven> then mc
13:31  Garoth> mc does ftp?!
13:31  koniu> dunno, i havent used it in ages
13:31  farhaven> yup
13:31  koniu> but yeah, mc pretty neat
13:32  stillunknown> Ever considered using gui apps where convient.
13:32  Gigamo> ncftp is good
13:32  Gigamo> :p
13:32  Garoth> ncftp is "okay"
13:32  koniu> i thought lftp > ncftp
13:33  Garoth> I really liked gftp-text. It had color and proper globbing.
13:33  koniu> ncftp is weird
13:33  Garoth> But it's a bit buggy.
13:33  tychoish> I'm using inconsolata now, which looks more like monaco does than monaco, oddly, but I'm not questioning 
13:34  koniu> i see ncftp now has ncurses and version 3, forget i'm talking 10 years ago
13:34  Gigamo> im still failing to turn off antialiasing or to display it without xft
13:34  Gigamo> :|
13:35  Garoth> Oh well, back to gftp-text for me :)
13:36  Garoth> stillunknown: so yeah, ever seen fonts fucked up like that? :)
13:37  Garoth> I'm not really looking for a solution unless you just happen to have one.
13:37  Garoth> Terminus seems to be okay.

13:38  Cosmonaut> I don't really need bold in terminal...
13:38  Garoth> Oh, you know... I have an idea
13:38  pyrho> Cosmonaut: same ! how do you do that ? :P
13:39  Cosmonaut> set urxvt.boldFont to the same thing as urxvt.font

13:43  stillunknown> Garoth: No.
13:43  Garoth> jd_: oh! You know what would be perfect in awesome? There was this feature in Compiz called "Maximumize"
13:43  Garoth> Basically, what it did was make the window bigger as long as it didn't overlap another window or go offscreen
13:43  Cosmonaut> Garoth: wants spinning cubes in awesome
13:44  Garoth> Cosmonaut: 
13:44  *** Garoth shakes his head at you
13:44  Cosmonaut>  <-- knows how to upset Garoth now
13:44  Garoth> Anyway, so, right. Imagine you're using the floating layout and no_overlap
13:44  Garoth> Cosmonaut: I'm not entirely sure you understand why I shook my head at you.
13:45  Cosmonaut> on-topic: suggestion sounds nice
13:45  Garoth> Mostly it was, "oh poor noob thinks that compiz only does decoration"

17:06  Cosmonaut> ah ok, in the default I can tell... it's a blue-ish color
17:06  Cosmonaut> but you may want to change it to something brighter
17:06  snowj> Cosmonaut, yeh, I like the default one pretty much tho, well I did'nt take a look yet..
17:06  Cosmonaut> I have a neon green border on mine
17:06  snowj> Which one is it that you use?
17:07  Cosmonaut> just made it myself..
17:07  snowj> ahw,ok.
17:07  drone77> jt_: xmodmap?
17:08  Cosmonaut> snowj: http://nico.nell.googlepages.com/pacman.png
17:08  Cosmonaut> so between two clients like that, you can't tell which one is highlighted?
17:09  snowj> ah , ok yeah Cosmonaut, thats much easier to distinguish
17:09  jt_> drone77: I think I can do loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/i386/dvorak/dvorak-kmap.tar.gz
17:09  q:muammar:(~muammar@190.38.144.71)

17:10  snowj> whatever option in the theme that is heh
17:10  Cosmonaut> ah ok, that is easy
17:10  jt_> awww..changing layouts will probably mess with my bindings :/
17:10  Cosmonaut> one sec
17:11  snowj> Cosmonaut, just tell me what your setting is there, that looks decent
17:11  Cosmonaut> in the default theme file I changed border_focus to #99FF77

17:32  koniu> some options?
17:32  Garoth> koniu: yeah, they don't want you writing trojans in modeline scripts, so only some options are allowed in them

18:00  Garoth> Industrial: at the top of your rc.lua is a theme path
18:00  Garoth> koniu: shall I put it there
18:00  Garoth> Something like, garoth.com/awesome
18:00  Industrial> oh, im blind >_<
18:00  Garoth> koniu: very cool stuff by the way, way better than I expected
18:00  stillunknown> koniu: It remembers tag names upon exit or just hard coded stuff?
18:01  koniu> Garoth: sure go ahead, put it up
18:02  koniu> stillunknown: just the configured ones but if you have most of your apps assigned to tags in config.apps upon restart clients nicely find their way to their tags
18:02  erikg> i have awesome git running on an XO
18:02  Garoth> erikg: nice ;)
18:02  stillunknown> erikg: you were the guy who mentioned the titlebar issues?
18:02  erikg> stillunknown: yes
18:03  stillunknown> It should be better now.
18:03  stillunknown> Since a day or so.
18:03  erikg> i saw the fix... *fast*
18:03  erikg> yeah
18:03  erikg> thanks
18:03  Garoth> koniu: should probably save which tags exist in what order, no?
18:04  j:nisc:(~nisc@sedanet0.sedan.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE)
18:04  koniu> Garoth: that's like session management which i wasn't gonna do. i'm possibly gonna split the matching off and pack it into a separate module and then add some more, although i think farhaven was up to something like that
18:04  Garoth> koniu: no, not session management
18:04  Garoth> And yes, farhaven did implement it
18:05  Garoth> But all I want in shifty would be that tags that you create on the fly and their positions are remembered. 
18:05  Garoth> I think that makes sense.
18:05  Garoth> (or maybe as an option)
18:05  koniu> remembered across sessions?
18:05  Garoth> koniu: yes
18:05  Garoth> So if I make a tag, reboot, come back to awesome, the tag still exists
18:06  koniu> yeah, would have to dump them to a file
18:06  Garoth> koniu: yeah, just dump to a file whenever they're changed, and load at start.
18:06  Garoth> You can put the file in .cache/awesome, if I recall correctly
18:06  koniu> yeah i know
18:07  koniu> hmmm
18:07  koniu> here's what i'll do
18:07  koniu> separate matching out of shifty into some other well-named module which will take care of session management
18:08  Garoth> koniu: uhm...
18:08  Garoth> That sounds like overkill, no?
18:08  Garoth> Well, if you want, sure
18:08  Garoth> Anyway, good module. I've heard a bunch of people say they want something like this.
18:09  koniu> thanks, it was pretty broken a week ago but last couple of days achieved some cool stuff (in-place renaming \o)
18:09  stillunknown> Keep the session management seperate, because that'll involve more stuff.
18:10  koniu> stillunknown: yeah, that's my view too
18:10  stillunknown> Even the cached naming is problematic, imagine every terminal going to the same place.
18:10  koniu> a lot of tag-unrelated stuff
18:10  Garoth> Yeah, makes sense.
18:10  Garoth> stillunknown: ?
18:10  koniu> didnt get that either
18:10  q:jt_:(~jake@68.42.230.212)
18:10  stillunknown> Let's say you have one terminal on a special tag.
18:10  Garoth> This isn't session management for everything, just for tags we're talking about here
18:11  stillunknown> You mean static tag cache?
18:11  Garoth> Well... dynamic tag cache
18:11  stillunknown> Ignore me :-)
18:11  Garoth> I don't know why you're making up names for stuff really
18:11  koniu> XD
18:11  Garoth> Take tag names in the order, write to file
18:11  Garoth> read later.
18:11  Garoth> That's it.
18:12  stillunknown> I was thinking of tags reappearing based on apps, which was my thinko.
18:12  koniu> stillunknown: you can control stuff like this using custom -name (urxvt) which changes 'instance' of the client
18:13  Garoth> Yeah, that is a bit tricky, I understand now.
18:13  stillunknown> Yes, but how often will you actually do that, and how convient is it.
18:13  koniu> depends on your approach to tags
18:13  stillunknown> Terminals could be needed anywhere.
18:13  koniu> i tend to have all terminals in one tag
18:14  stillunknown> And having one at the push of two or three buttons is nice
18:14  Garoth> I think that if set a custom thing like that on a app which you're using all the time (urxvt), it's your own fault if it does something funky
18:14  koniu> stillunknown: still possible, i have it so that it switches to the 'term' tag when i do  'new term' binding
18:14  Garoth> koniu: garoth.com/awesome/shifty.ogv
18:15  stillunknown> Indeed, but that does make tags that automagically remember their previous owner unlikely.
18:15  koniu> 'previous owner'?

18:15  q:Blankoworld:(~blankowor@portedesetoiles.homelinux.com)

18:16  stillunknown> Open tag, open app, rename tag, close app, open app, tag opens with that name
18:16  koniu> gonna put the link there if u don't mind
18:16  stillunknown> Anyway, very nice what you've done so far.
18:16  koniu> stillunknown: gotcha. hmm....
18:17  koniu> stillunknown: that'd be pretty tricky
18:17  stillunknown> One final (personal) question though, why the strange green color?
18:17  koniu> i'm gonna give it a good think while cleaning up shifty for release
18:17  koniu> green color?
18:17  stillunknown> In the movie.
18:18  koniu> where's green :)
18:18  stillunknown> You have a black and green theme (even on firefox).
18:18  koniu> is it green
18:18  stillunknown> What do you call it?
18:18  koniu> #524E41
18:18  koniu> ?
18:18  koniu> on my screen it's quite grey

18:20  Garoth> koniu: and link away.
18:20  tychoish> it's not grey, because the hex pairs aren't the same 
18:20  Garoth> koniu: also, does shifty support all those things that the current tags do?
18:21  j:eyolf:(~weechat@0x50c733c2.boanqu1.static.dsl.tele.dk)
18:21  Garoth> Like viewing multiple tags, putting a window on multiple tags?
18:21  Garoth> And what happened to them little squares? :)
18:21  j:Blankoworld:(~blankowor@portedesetoiles.homelinux.com)
18:21  stillunknown> And will there be support for app rules that will create a tag for each instance, as opposed to putting them all on one.
18:21  koniu> Garoth: squares i don't use, doesn't makes sense without loads of empty tags
18:22  koniu> stillunknown: that works already, provided that you can match the clients with different class, instance or role
18:22  Garoth> koniu: yes, but they have another use -- when you're focussed on a window, it'll fill in the square for all the tags that have that window
18:22  stillunknown> koniu: I mean identical clients.
18:23  koniu> stillunknown: could do that, i guess
18:23  stillunknown> It's not extremely important, just a thought.
18:23  stillunknown> (don't clutter up the design for just that)
18:23  koniu> stillunknown: sure why not :)
18:24  Garoth> koniu: ?
18:24  j:jt_:(~jake@68.42.230.212)
18:25  koniu> Garoth: yeah, the current tags... most of the stuff works the same by inheritance
18:25  Garoth> Oh, okay.
18:25  koniu> but it surely is buggy
18:26  Garoth> You might want to make the squares optional if you haven't already.
18:26  koniu> i havent gotten to the stage of what happens when i run my functions with more than one tag selected or client in more than one tag
18:26  Garoth> I guess I don't really care about them either, but maybe someone does
18:26  koniu> squares should work, havent tried tho
18:26  Garoth> koniu: well, don't worry too much. We're just jumping on you with suggestions because we think what you've made here is cool.

18:33  Garoth> eyolf: you must know by now. Even if you think awesome isn't yet the best wm ever, its obvious that it will be in short order.
18:33  eyolf> is shifty available?
18:33  j:adlpaf-mobile:(~adlpaf-mo@190.37.210.169)
18:33  Garoth> eyolf: sure, though he said earlier today that it wasn't "release quality"
18:33  Garoth> Seemed to work okay in the video. Anyway.
18:34  erikg> man it's annoying that icons aren't all vector-based
18:34  q:stillunknown:(~stillunkn@82-136-225-75.ip.telfort.nl)
18:34  Garoth> eyolf: git.mercenariesguild.net, in the shifty branch
18:34  eyolf> Garoth: I know by now. 
18:34  erikg> although i understand why it's been hard to implement
18:34  Garoth> erikg: well... not tremendously :)
18:34  Garoth> He managed it in 250 lines of code.
18:35  Garoth> Pretty clever stuff.
18:35  eyolf> Garoth: thanks for the link
18:35  Garoth> eyolf: think you'll find your way okay?
18:35  Garoth> http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome.git;a=blob;f=lib/shifty.lua.in;h=45afa1ea932ea7f2fdcd311053e91f79f81ab827;hb=e1e8a27c13b91813563524c62fb4e685fd759408
18:35  eyolf> Garoth: we'll see... :)
18:35  eyolf> if not, I'll come crying for help
18:35  Garoth> eyolf: if you don't want to do it the git way, there is a link to the file itself ^
18:36  Garoth> http://git.mercenariesguild.net/?p=awesome.git;a=blob_plain;f=lib/shifty.lua.in;hb=e1e8a27c13b91813563524c62fb4e685fd759408
18:36  Garoth> ^ better link
18:36  Garoth> eyolf: so yeah, there you go if you don't want to use git to grab the branch
18:39  erikg> shifty is cool :)
18:39  Garoth> Yep.
18:40  *** drone77 is new to awesome and wondering if he should use 3 as opposed to 2 (what I found in the debian lenny repos)
18:41  Garoth> drone77: welcome.
18:41  Garoth> I highly recommend that you use 3 unless you're violently opposed to configuring your system in lua.
18:41  Garoth> (an easy programming language)
18:41  erikg> hm.  awesome interacts oddly with xcompmgr.  doesn't seem to be any effect on the XO when i run it :(
18:41  Garoth> erikg: what effects are you expecting?
18:42  erikg> i would expect that firefox wouldn't have to redraw itself every time i switch into it after running xcompmgr
18:42  erikg> but it still does
18:42  erikg> no change.  i'm checking my x setup.
18:42  Garoth> drone77: also, seeing as you're likely to end up building it yourself, I recommend you build the latest source from git. This'll get you the most features (and they come in quick), at the expense of occasionally having to fix your config when the API changes.
18:42  drone77> well i have no experience of lua but i'm progressing nicely with python (hobbyist)
18:42  Garoth> erikg: yes, that happens to me as well. I'm not sure what awesome is doing exactly.
18:42  erikg> hmmm
18:42  Garoth> drone77: you should find lua easy enough if you know Python reasonably well.
18:43  Garoth> The syntax and concepts are relatively similar
18:43  erikg> Garoth: so i know that it works *beautifully* under matchbox
18:43  erikg> on the same hardware
18:43  drone77> Garoth: yeah, I've been having a little peek, and it doesn't seem too bad
18:43  erikg> Garoth: ok, so this is something to work on
18:43  Garoth> erikg: it could very well be that awesome is different because it's the only wm out there that uses xcb
18:44  Garoth> drone77: and especially, awesome's lua is very easy to work with.
18:44  erikg> Garoth: right, but we should get it to play nice if at all possible
18:44  erikg> it would make sense
18:44  Garoth> Of course.
18:44  Garoth> However, effects do work.
18:44  Garoth> (such as real transparency and transparent windows)
18:45  Garoth> erikg: are you like working for the XO people or what?
18:45  Garoth> OLPC
18:45  erikg> i'm an OLPC employee
18:45  Garoth> Well, hopefully you continue to like awesome.
18:45  Garoth> It is a relatively new WM.
18:45  erikg> Garoth: yup
18:46  erikg> i like it i bit.  i'm trying to work out a demo of it as an alternative default WM to the Sugar interface which has been developed here
18:46  erikg> (i like it a bit)
18:46  Garoth> Yeah, makes sense.
18:46  erikg> i use it on my own system.  no one uses sugar on their own systems...
18:46  snowj> Its far the best I've been using so far... finally BYE BYE mouse
18:46  Garoth> Of course not.
18:47  Garoth> Awesome is a very flexible wm, actually.
18:47  erikg> unless they a core developer (maybe) or if they're one of the 400k students who are forced to use it because it comes on their computers by default
18:47  snowj> If just I could copy stuff from weechat by keyboard :S
18:47  erikg> sugar is having trouble with non-sugarized application compatibility
18:47  erikg> matchbox isn't helping, as it only has one idea of what a window should do (occupy the full screen)
18:47  Garoth> heh
18:47  erikg> so at very least we wanted to move away from the situation in which the only way to run a 'legacy' application like the gimp is to run it in xephyr!
18:48  Garoth> Heh, legacy..
18:48  erikg> also, sugar is written in python
18:48  Garoth> Yeah.
18:48  erikg> and python has memory allocation problems it seems
18:48  Garoth> I know a bit about OLPC, sugar, and that whol emess.
18:48  erikg> as in... it's a hungry beast when you do anything complicated with it
18:48  Garoth> whole mess*
18:48  erikg> Garoth: really?  have you been following the news?
18:48  Garoth> erikg: maybe try an alternative python interpreter? IronPython or PiPi?
18:48  erikg> perhaps
18:48  Garoth> erikg: Yeah, at one point.
18:49  Garoth> Anyway, IronPython, though it's meant for .NET interaction I've heard is faster than CPython
18:49  drone77> Garoth: right I'll grab the git source in the morning, thanks for the warm welcome
18:49  erikg> i think the big problem is that the kernel can't manage shared memory well when it's python bytecode...
18:49  Garoth> drone77: have fun. We'll be around to help.
18:49  erikg> so it's a mess, but we are succeeding
18:50  erikg> and to stave off the possibility of windows running on a lot of XOs we (the OLPC core devs) need to work hard to either make sugar truly usable (which i am unsure can happen) or make a lot of viable alternatives for people
18:50  koniu> btw, re shifty: if u wanna try it, search for shifty in http://pastebin.com/f2d3a18b8 to so how it usable at this stage. i'm gonna try to complete a wiki page along with more cleanups to get people going with minimum hassle (brb)
18:50  j:canen:(~canen@72.252.109.32)
18:51  erikg> Garoth: anyway, so here i am, and i'll stay until i at least get a demo together
18:51  Garoth> erikg: well, sweet :)
18:51  Garoth> I wouldn't mind having my favourite WM running on a whole lot of computers
18:51  erikg> right.  and i wouldn't mind having a really active developer community using and building that WM
18:52  Garoth> But maybe I should reconsider that extremely sexy default background I was making, haha ;)
18:52  erikg> or at least the core of whatever WM is distributed
18:52  erikg> hehe
18:52  erikg> you know... kids can't modify the background on Sugar
18:52  Garoth> (I'll make it anyway, you just don't have to use it)
18:52  erikg> i don't even know how to yet...
18:52  Garoth> Lol?
18:52  Garoth> Can you, like, use the command line to?
18:52  Garoth> Or is it like some silly window being rendered on top of the real root window?
18:52  erikg> when i was in urugay visiting the technical team there and attending some conferences i heard about kids who were charging other kids money to change the icons to one of the local futbol teams
18:52  erikg> hehe
18:53  erikg> it's a silly window being rendered on top of the real root window
18:53  erikg> so they can do hippocanvas stuff to it
18:53  Garoth> Fair enough.
18:53  erikg> now the sugar devs are having perf issues with hippocanvas and the svg icon rendering
18:53  eyolf> Garoth: how do I pull that branch into an existing git repo?
18:53  erikg> anyway, i found it kind've hilarious that our design gaffaws were making industry in uruguay
18:54  Garoth> eyolf: well, use git remote add to add the repository -- git://git.mercenariesguild.net/awesome.git
18:54  Garoth> eyolf: name it something meaningful, like "mg"
18:54  Garoth> eyolf: and then, if I recall correctly, you git fetch mg
18:54  Garoth> Or git pull.
18:55  Garoth> And then you git checkout -b shifty mg/shifty
18:55  eyolf> ok
18:55  eyolf> thanks
18:55  Garoth> Which makes a new local branch called shifty, sets it up to track mg/shifty on the remote end, and switches into that branch
18:55  Garoth> erikg: It's a shame that the OLPC had so much trouble along the way.
18:56  Garoth> I always liked the sound of the project from the start, but I'm getting the feeling that they really dropped the ball on their innovative interface plans
18:56  Garoth> Or rather that they were too innovative or somewhat misguided
19:01  q:iamFIREcracker:(~qwerty@host-78-12-101-221.cust-adsl.tiscali.it)
19:03  erikg> Garoth: http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud describes it pretty well
19:03  erikg> not enough developers
19:03  erikg> too much pressur
19:03  erikg> pressure
19:03  erikg> a lot of hubris...
19:03  erikg> mix, bake, == ball of mud
19:04  Garoth> Hey, sounds like everything we make here at Xandros
19:06  erikg> hehe
19:07  erikg> that paper is awesome
19:07  erikg> i'm reading it in bits and pieces
19:07  erikg> it says that spaghetticode is a legitimate design path
19:08  erikg> Garoth: any ideas about the xcompmgr issue?
19:08  Garoth> erikg: not in the least, I have no clue at all what is going on in the bowels of awesome
19:09  Garoth> In fact, it's insulting to the other developers to call me one :)
19:09  Garoth> erikg: did you ever get your desired icons in tags thing?
19:10  q:Evanlec:(~weechat@d-24-233-110-24.cpe.metrocast.net)
19:11  erikg> Garoth: it's going to take some hacking
19:11  Garoth> I see.
19:11  erikg> for a first pass (the demo) i'm going to use ascii-art
19:12  Garoth> So tags aren't, like, mini wiboxes?
19:12  erikg> the problem is there is just a textbox in there and we need an imagebox to show the image
19:12  erikg> apparently not... interesting
19:12  erikg> some abstractions maybe should be clarified
19:12  j:Evanlec:(~weechat@d-24-233-110-24.cpe.metrocast.net)
19:12  Garoth> Well, uhm, can't you just put an imagebox in instead of a textbox?
19:12  Garoth> erikg: or does the syntax I once saw work -- in a textbox, <img>path</img>?
19:14  Garoth> w
19:14  Garoth> Nope that doesn't work
19:14  erikg> right
19:17  erikg> so why are tag boxes and task boxes implemented differently?
19:17  Garoth> Dunno.
19:18  erikg> jt_: any reason ^ ?
19:18  Garoth> erikg: you mean jd_ 
19:18  erikg> hehe
19:19  erikg> jd_: 
19:21  Garoth> Well, I'm going home.

19:48  koniu> what do you mean implemented differently?
19:48  koniu> one deals with tags and other with clients?
19:54  erikg> koniu: i mean that the tasklist buttons have icons and text in them
19:54  erikg> whereas we can't put icons in the taglist buttons
19:54  koniu> hmmm, hey that's a valid point
19:55  koniu> didnt occur to me before
19:58  erikg> doesn't mean that tasklist and taglist have to be the same thing, just that it makes sesne for them to share code
19:58  erikg> which would give us more flexibility as a result
19:59  koniu> lmao
19:59  j:Eitx_:(~Eitx@124.114.50.128)

21:23  koniu> yey icons in taglist
21:23  koniu> erikg: almost there
21:23  Jakob_the_liar> you have a screenshot koniu ?

21:48  Jakob_the_liar> i want to use urxvt but it gives me problems
21:48  Caleb`> like what
21:49  Caleb`> works great here
21:49  Jakob_the_liar> like the text is in the wrong places when i move the windows
21:49  Jakob_the_liar> like it will be in the middle or the bottom where i cant see

21:50  snowj> Jakob_the_liar, is that true or fake transparency?
21:50  Jakob_the_liar> not sure what you mean?
21:50  Jakob_the_liar> its xcompmgr 
21:51  snowj> ok, aint that slowing things down?
21:51  snowj> I tried it once.
21:51  *** Caleb` uses fake transparency when he uses transparency
21:51  Jakob_the_liar> whats fake transparency?
21:51  j:CIA-6:(~CIA@208.69.182.149)
21:51  Jakob_the_liar> when i maximize urxvt it can see through to the next window instead of going to the background
21:51  Jakob_the_liar> which makes it hard to read
21:52  Caleb`> well with fake you cant see behind the window
21:52  Caleb`> just the wallpaper
21:52  Jakob_the_liar> how do i do that?
21:52  Caleb`> set it in your Xdefaults

21:55  Caleb`> 'hah
21:55  Caleb`> wanna see my new one
21:55  Caleb`> i slapped it up just to see if transparency works so dont judge me too bad

21:57  Jakob_the_liar> false*
21:57  Caleb`> yeah
21:57  Jakob_the_liar> if i could get urxvt to behave like gnome-terminal id use it exclusively 
21:57  Jakob_the_liar> but it f's up alot
21:58  Caleb`> behave how?
21:58  Caleb`> and what f's up
21:58  Caleb`> use what we showed and it will be fine
21:58  Jakob_the_liar> like when i resize it the text will be all over the place
21:58  Jakob_the_liar> or duplicate text
21:58  Caleb`> ive not had any problems with mine

22:08  Jakob_the_liar> im use to ctrl c for copy and v for paste
22:09  Caleb`> so youre having pasting problems?
22:09  Caleb`> hilight it whatever you wanna paste with your mouse and middle click
22:09  takeshita_kenji> Do you have a middle mouse button?

22:10  Caleb`> click both buttons at the same time
22:10  Jakob_the_liar> alright cool
22:11  takeshita_kenji> I have a question regarding Awesome 3 configuration.
22:12  takeshita_kenji> Has anyone written a script to do something of a translation between the old libconfuse file and the new Lua file?
22:13  takeshita_kenji> It's not that Lua is difficult, it's that I have so many entries that it'd be tedious.
